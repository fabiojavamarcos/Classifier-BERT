18;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;fix edits getting lost in biblatex mode;this fixes a bug where edits made in a field on a compressedentryeditortab wouldn t get stored when the field editor lost focus. the bug was caused by entryeditortabfocuslistener accessing the unused inherited parent field of compressedentryeditortab instances instead of the latter class s own (private) parent field. instead of doing just a quick fix  i decided to eliminate the excessive code and data duplication in the two classes altogether and consolidate them into one class (with an additional flag to the constructor)  since i don t think an extra class is warranted here (and easily and sensibly implementable by derivation).;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

24;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;extend biblatex: support for alias fields;- added support for aliased fields. for example  the content in the  journaltitle  field is also shown in the  journal  table. - added cleanup option to convert to the new biblatex format - modified the required/optional fields for biblatex entries to reflect the above changes (the  year  field is no longer required);;;;;;;;;1;0;;

45;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;added the option to change the table row height padding.;previously  the padding added to the row height for the main table was hardcoded. the padding value can now be modified by the user through the preferences dialog. the old hardcoded value is used as the default value for the new preference.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

47;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;added the ability to reorder the panels in the side pane.;side pane panels now feature an up arrow button and a down arrow button immediately to the left of the close button. these buttons allow panes to be swapped with the pane above or below them  respectively.  whenever the panes are reordered  the current position of each visible pane is recorded in the application preferences  so the user s custom ordering can be preserved when jabref is next run.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

55;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;mac bundle and integration for java 7;these changes creates a new compilation target for jabref  in order to make a mac application bundle which can work with the newer oracle jvm for mac (versions 7 and 8)  and change the code of the wrapper to integrate the apple events with the non-deprecated api in com.apple.eawt.  main changes are: - create a new target based on oracle s appbundler to create a bundle compatible with newer jvms. (not compatible with apple s jvm). - move the older target to jabref-legacy.app. - remove the old deprecated wrapper osxadapter  which does not work with oracle s jvm. - create new wrapper based on com.apple.eawt (compatible with both jvms). - improve the quit behaviour. - add support for the fullscreen feature.  the code changes are compatible with both oracle s jvms and apple legacy one  but the legacy bundle is currently broken as the code requires java 1.7+. tested with apple s jvm (1.6.0_65) and oracle s jvm (1.8.0_45).;;;;;;;;;1;0;;
56;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;fix double-click opening of files on mac;moving the registration of apple events ensures that double-clicking on a file to open it works even if jabref is not yet running.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;
65;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;1;1;1;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;1;1;replace usages of preferences by string through constants;i checked all the usage of strings for getting or setting preferences and replaced them by a the usage of a constant  if one existed. this gives some more static checking and consistency throughout the project. changes are limited to  src/main/java .   again this changes nothing functionwise  but only improves code quality.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

468;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;improved duplicate checker;i changed the core function of the duplicate checker from correlation to approximate string matching. this enables the test to work (which earlier failed as  bob  and  joyce  was deemed as close enough to indicate a duplicate). probably some of the constants used for comparison needs to be tuned. also  as the approximate string matching is based on edit distance (the number of edits required to turn one string into the other)  it might be that one may operate the complete comparison on the full string rather than the word by word style as currently is used.  i think this is good to go (in the sense that it probably performs better than the previous)  but please check it with a few different databases to make sure that the false positives or missing hits are to frequent.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

677;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;make bibtex parser more robust against missing newlines;as described in #669 and #621 the parser has some problems when an entry (or preamble) follows directly the file encoding header (on the same line)  i.e.   % encoding: myencoding @article{} . actually  as the tests reveal it was not a problem with the actual parser but within the file opening logic.  i don t view this pr as a complete fix for #669 and #621 since not just the parser but also the serialization should be improved.  also fix a bug that prevented the import of bibtex entries having only a key as its content.;;;;;;;;;1;0;;

1207;0;1;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;1;0;0;1;restructure importers;the aim of this pr is to reduce the overlap between the importer package and some code in gui (in particular  the class opendatabaseaction). moreover  #1080 and #1153 are fixed.  in detail  the following things were changed: - the abstract  importformat  class is almost completely rewritten. please have a look at this class. almost all other changes are a direct consequence of the edits made to the importformat class. the biggest change is that the import method returns a  parserresult  instead of a list of entries (in this way  metadata can also be imported and error messages are communicated more effectively instead of throwing ioexceptions). moreover  the import method operates on a reader instead of an input stream in order to reduce some common code in all importers. -  add method  importdatabase(path file  charset encoding)  to the importer interface which opens the file and passes the stream to the other import method. - the bibteximporter overwrites this new import method and uses the logic from  opendatabaseaction.loaddatabase  to determine the encoding of the bib file. - change opendatabaseaction to operate against the bibtex importer.  - remove get/set iscustomimporter: was not really used (just for sorting - now everything is alphabetical) - empty entries are no longer imported (thus a few test had to be changed)  remark: the methods getextension and getdescription are not implemented by almost any importer. this should be done. maybe this is something for the stupro?  (will add the changelog entry and add a few tests later) -   -   -   ();;;;;;;;;1;0;;

also i find it better to do the path conversion in one place only but if we want to pass a stream of paths we always have to do that beforehand - regarding unification of importer tests: i have refactored around a little and arrived at a solution that should work for all importers i quite like how that condenses the `risimportertestfiles` classfun fact: i may have used junit 5 paramterization but so far the assertions were still junit 4 ill change that in the following || the importer tests where running for each file but that seems to have been ignored in the migration process by the junit 5 compi looked at this too but didnt find a way to get it to work again || yes indeed ill gradually go through all parameterized importer tests and try to get them working in junit 5 syntax again as part of this pr || turns out quite a lot of tests for different importers (bibtexml medline tested so far) actually fail and this is down to the implementations of the importers seems like these tests have never been executed beforei am not sure what to do about this here the point of this pr was a refactoring of the testing code not a repair of broken importers || i would merge this if all tests are at least executed or better you merge this in a new branch where we will fix the importer then || i converted and  some fetcher tests in another pr i found that the gvk test would also be a goo candidate for using the same schema as here  || i have now migrated the complete importer tests to junit5 syntaxsadly they are in a dire state a lot of them are actually failing and seemed to have never been executed anyway and even except from the refactorings that i have already done there as a lot of things that can still be improvedi think its best if we take the current (failing) state and try to repair each importer and its tests here in the pr this might be some work but the importer tests cannot really continue as broken as they are now help on this is very much appreciated and should be possible without conflicts || you can ignore the failing fetcher test this is already fixed but i wonder why there is now an npe with the method source || i should have more meetings so that i get more programming done :)i think i have repair all importers and their tests now ill see what travis says and ill also do one more round of refactoring on the code (not now) when i am done this can hopefully be  lgtm! if you merge master in your branch you will get the fetcher test fixed as well || ok this can be merged from my point of viewalthough this is already a huge refactoring of the existing tests theres certainly more that can be improved i have a few things in mind but i would rather keep them out of this already big pr ill tackle them later when this is merged || that looks weird indeed looking at the first one:  the `importdatabase` method is recorded as not covered but when i execute the tests in intellij there are twenty test files for that method alone the key seems to be that the missing methods are the ones that use junit5 parameterized tests it seems that codecov does not record the coverage of these tests but they are the core tests of the whole packagebut maybe the problem is still travis? how do i see from our travis output that the tests are really executed? i can push a failing test deliberately but there surely is a better way? || since the travis log contains statement like >13 57686 [main] warn  orgjabreflogicmsbibmsbibdatabase - could not parse documenti suppose the tests are correctly invoked (in fact the travis log exploded even more) probably there is a problem with the gradle task `jacocojunit5testreport` (but there is no need to fix this in this pr) || i would merge this in and i think tthere might be a solution for the reports: ||;parameterized tests are not executed on travis;based on this discussion:  seems that the move to junit5 has somehow turned off the parameterized tests on travis thats bad because it means that our importer tests are basically gone we need a way to re-enable them most likely by adapting them to junit5 syntax;if i execute them in eclipse with junit5 they are listed as a single test || for the migration to junit5 refs  || are these tests running now?

implemented as a list (see line 260 and 110)can i drop the list?@siedlerchr @koppor @tobiasdiez  || i have no real idea concerning your question about the list i would say you could safely remove it but im not sure what happens if multiple entries have the same file linked and write their metadata into it (eg the pdf is a book and i have a bunch of `bookchapters` as separate entries)? || xmputilwriter line 147148before new metadata is written to the pdf all dublincoreschemas are removed so i think that there is currently no option to write more than one metaschemain your case i would assume that the last written data is visible (others lost) || well does the dublin core schema specify multiple entries?  || specifications are available at  the abstract model is there:  case i interpret that correctly one record contains one description which may contain multiple record setsthis is the edge case where one wants to write xmp to a proceedingsexample:- one chapter:  full proceedings:  || i considered all comments to the source code and refactored my code the last commit alters the behavior of the xmp import:the previous implementation only imports the first entry and drops the others the current implementation imports all metadata entries my thoughts are as follows: it is easier to import additional entries and delete not needed ones compared to importing single entries by hand if the needed entry is not the first one  ||;bibtexml vs bibtexmp;jabref 32it seems that jabref offers a second kind of xml serialization in bibtex:```xmlns:bibtex it is not worth to keep two different xml schemas for an xml serialization of bibtex afaik there isnt even one for jabrefs xml therefore i propose that we should use [bibtexml ]( only and migrate old xmp meta data to the bibtexml formatxmp examples can be found at https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/blob/fc82796f1f99c00a01ccdb9dd4fff792a40b7e75/src/test/java/net/sf/jabref/logic/xmp/xmputiltestjava#l139;""refs #898 || im not really following the argumentation one may argue of different export formats but how is it relevant that they are both xml? isnt it more of an issue if it is a relevant format in itself? || context: the format is used for storing bibtex data in xml files using the xmp functionality (follow `netsfjabreflogicxmpxmpschemabibtex`) this pdf meta data is used by other people to exchange pdfs with the correct bibliographic data without being forced to send the bib entry along with the pdf in two filesi am arguing that jabref uses a proprietary format which is not used elsewhere thus our xmp data cannot be processed by other software i see the point that the last commit at the [current bibtexml repository]( is from 2011 nevertheless i vote for joining forces these formats are too similar to go into different directionsi see following alternatives:1 replace jabrefs bibtexmp by the canonical bibtex representation2 completely use rdf there seem multiple bibtex2rdf converters available:  maybe owl is also an option:  move to bibtexml (as outlined in the original issue)4 use [mods]( keep everything as issomehow the current code seems to use """"[dublin core]( which reads good maybe that code can just be used and the other serialization using `{ can be removed completely needs to be investigated furtherin case everything is replaced by dublin core one can update pdfbox - see  || ah ok so bibtexmp is jabrefs own format? then it clearly makes moresense so not support exporting in that || the question would be: how many people actually use the xmp feature?from my point of view i would suggest supporting the bibtexml format and maybe add the rdf/owl stuff as an addition interestingly there is also a paper about bibtexml: a quick look at the code you referenced i saw that it uses rdf-tags  || the xmp feature is _the_ central tool to distribute pdfs with bibliographic information i learned it from [adrian daerr]( (possibly @adriandaerr?)i am also confused by the code and also had the strange feelings about nesting jabrefs bibtexml into rdf tags therefore i proposed to focus on dublin core  (see above) || thanks for inviting me to the discussion! the bibtexml we developed and implemented ( is a different one than the sourceforge repo the paper is from 15 years ago and while we used the language in a later project ( the software produced by that project is not really used anywhere as far as i can tell i did hand the sources to some people who liked it and wanted to have a bibtex-xml converter but i dont think anybody ever made their versions public i think our xml schema was pretty well-desgined but its something i havent looked at in quite a while || either format you prefer to embed in pdf would be great if it is compatible with pdf/a compliance checksjabref 2x embeds caused errors like:> xmp metadata property used which is not predefined in the xmp specification of january 2004 there is no xmp extension schema present in the pdf defining the use and contents of this property some pdf-based iso standards require that all xmp metadata properties are either predefined or defined in an embedded extension schemaif it will be format like bibtexml that can be exported in xml it would be also great to have some minimal example for correct embedding it through latex with [`xmpincl`]( or [`hyperxmp`]( packages use case: compiling thesis with embeded metadata precomposed with jabref || after dealing with this in #1096 i think the most portable solution would be to drop the jabref bibtexmp and to encode everything into dublin core (which we already do on top of our custom serialization)that is if we do not decide to drop the xmp functionality completely || some info about correct storage of xmp inside pdf (to be compatible with pdf/a for example) can be found with samples at  goes free xmp validator:  java code samples can also be found at that website || idea (as discussed with @hummelriegel): add bibtexs of cited entries to the pdf this is especially useful for a self-written paper || further options include bibtexml and mods i think dublin core is still the way to go as it is standards-based we should go in this direction || refs  || hi guys i am not developer i am just another user i really hope that you **maintain the xml feature** this one of the most important unique feature of jabref that keep me come back time and time again (after using great reference manager like bookends) the xml is useful not just for sharing pdf files **embedding the information into the pdf is very useful for powerful search tools like deveonthink[mac] spotlight[mac] dtsearch[windows]** with the embedded data it is possible to search pdf files by their author title and the like data in addition re-generating the jabref library from the pdf files (incase the library is corrupted or deleted) is possible with the embedded data i had a couple of cases where my pdf files get dissociated from the reference i drag them back voilÃ  i have the whole reference this is just so great  || hi dellu thanks for the praise! and no worries we have no intentions of removing support for this feature quite the contrary we would like to update and improve it unfortunately this has so far failed due to issues in the libraries that we use for this functionality as a result i assume that there will be no significant changes here in the near future || thank you @lenhard i am glad you are going to keep the feature what do you guys think of [this]( ?they also write the metadata into the file using exiftool they use the standard bibtex tags the standard bibtex is  nice  || @dellu interesting link thanks! unfortunately it will not be easy to interact with that tool or the exiftool the former is written in c++ and the latter in perl whereas jabref is written in java there is always a way around the language differences but in my point of view we should stick to the java ecosystem and build a jabref where everything is closely integrated and without language-related frictionother developers might have a different opinion though || together with @snisnisniksonah i am investigating whether we can use dublin corecurrent steps:1 read/write pdf annotations using dublin core using pdfbox 2x (refs  extract command line tool to convert old pdf annotations to the new format (refs  -> xmputil will released separatelyresults:- jabref 4x depending on pdfbox 2x- xmputils depending on pdfbox 1x || nice! i think the xmputil is not that important since in most cases you can just write the information again to the pdf using dublin core and thus overwriting / """"converting"""" the old xmp data || note to self: do not forget  pdflatex can easily do that: [authorarchive]( check the example pdf ||

might have seen that i want to make a consistent layout for all panels toolbars etc ([issue here]( im going to wait with this until your pr here is pushed then i will merge the maintable-beta again into my local branch and incorporate all changes i really would like to have more icons on the toolbar to get a better feeling for the look || i grabbed the template from the material design icons and started to convert some of the icons we dont have in this style as an example emacs texstudio and vim ![emacs]( ![texstudio]( ![vim]( it be of interest if i pursue this further? if yes does someone know if we can include them as a vector font so that we have those icons scalable to whatever resolution we need? im worrying about retina displays or other 4k devices where 32x32 let alone 16x16 icons look not good || @halirutan i would suggest you contribute that upstream read more at  are also the [academic icons]( however there is none for tools but some for dois pubmed || @koppor i might be wrong but the readme there reads in its final paragraph:> please note that at this time the only brand icons we accept requests for are popular social media sites/apps and widely used products/software thanks for understandingin fact i have searched for vim and emacs on the site first and was stunned that such widely used apps cannot be found it doesnt matter i have successfully searched for a way to create our own ttf font for the icons in this way we can stay consistent with our design and we can adjust the icons as we like || @halirutan i would agree that emacs and vim are widely used in case there is no pr yet why not creating a pr? i have to admit that other software is not that popularmaybe we should start another font project? maybe we fit into the [academic icons]( at least i would try ðŸ˜‡ thus also the latex users would benefit from your work:  || why not forking academic icons and proposing our latex-related to them?//edit:: regading vim and emacs you might find them here: they also provide a font patcher || i think there is no real need to use a font-based icon svg images can be included more easily in javafx than font-based icons like this: only exception is if the font can be accessedfontawesomefx](  || @tobiasdiez i havent looked at this to be honest what about scaling? for some icons we set the size by giving the font-size like in the `entryeditorcss````tool-bar glyph-icon {    -glyph-size: 18px    -fx-font-size: 2em}```can we achieve consistent sizes when we use partly svg icons? i mean i see that we used `px` here but will this be the same when not used as a font? || good point the file-based icons are shown using  does provide some scale mechanisms but these are probably not accessible via css in general i agree that a font-based solution is desirable my comment should just serve as a warning that it might be not so easy to include an arbitrary font as icon sources and it may be easier to include the svg directly ||

here soon if this blocks progress somewhere else i have no problem if someone else takes over and rounds this off || of course no problem @lenhard since the only thing missing in this pr is the additional push to shared icon i merge now im looking forward to see more prs incoming as soon as your pc is relocated -) ||;improve ux of main toolbar;""not a pressing matter but we should at some point take care of this at the moment the current main toolbar looks like this on ubuntu![img]( things are noteworthy:1 the horizontal lines under the icons dont match left and right from the search they have a different hight2 the separators between icon-groups are not of the same size left and right from the search bar3 when using the global search the number of found hits is displayed this label uses a different font and is not readable [see image here]( on our way to migrating everything to javafx the background colors should be made consistenti have hacked a fix to test some things by (1) removing the borderlines completely and make the whole toolbar having a border (2) separating visually everything that is part of the global search (3) fixing background color this gives imo a much clearer view:![new toolbar]( believe we should take care of this when we migrate the toolbar to fx additionally  i have seen that the """"material icons"""" we use provide a template that lets you create your own icons i think we (i guess this would be my turn) should think about creating nice icons for the """"push to application"""" button to make them fit into our overall design im sure i can do this while making the icons still recognizable"";""good suggestion in the progress i would also like to condense it to say 5-10 useful actions (instead of > 20) and integrate the search bar prominently maybe even add some color something like this:( this rewrite might take a while could you in the meantime create a pr with your """"hack""""? it looks so much better than the current interface || the maintable-beta now has a restyled toolbar we still need to decide on the color and which icons to display (see discussion starting at  || @tobiasdiez thanks for the ping i looked at the current maintable-beta branch and in particular at the colors since this is currently a mess because in every `css` file different explicitly specified colors are used i started to separate everything into one `jabrefcolorscss` and tried to unify everything looking at the current state one thing beside the inconsistency hit me instantly: we are starting to mixing a dark-scheme with a bright-scheme what i mean by that is that i suggest we should stick with *dark information onto bright background*: dark icons onto a brighter toolbar dark menu text onto eg gray dark tool-tip text onto bright bg etcto make everything consistent we should first decide the one main theme color i believe this should stay the blue that we used for icons until recently maybe a slight variant based on this color we calculate the highlight colors that we need and maybe 4 neutral gray-tones ive done this several times and maybe the most prominent example where this increases usability are the solarized colors you want to ensure that all colors and grays love each otherthen the big fun begins because every fx component needs to be checked and restyled for testing i used very bright colors in a main color css file and replaced some of the component colors note i dont suggest any of the colors used here it was only my test-zone![img]( could make out several things:- all toolbars (the main the editor the groupview) should use the same style especially the icons should look the same although they may be of different size- it is a good thing to make borders that are resizable slightly visible it makes grabbing them so much easier (in the main-table columns this is currently a pain)- consistent highlighting colors for hovered or selected table rows active input fields selected tabs error marks like the small thing in the editorone final word on the things discussed in the pr: for me there are also way too few icons in the toolbar and i dont like a prominent search bar imo this search bar hype is overrated and especially in jabref i use it not even close as often as i use """"new entry"""" or """"push to app"""" searching is good but it should not be centered using half of the toolbar the social media icons are useless to me too but i understand the intention of @koppor although i dont believe that this indeed has the desired effect || """"search"""" is the most used feature by me in onenote i just use <kbd>ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>e</kbd> which is a [very good full-text search]( on all my notes || these are good points @halirutan a few colors are collected at the beginning of `maincss` but some are defined/inlined also in the `groupstreecss` and `entryeditorcss` now that everything derives from the `maincss` class we should put all colors there (or extract them to a separate file) since i have absolutely no background in ui design i took the design guidelines from [google]( and [microsoft]( as blueprints they mostly suggest to use a strong color for the titlebar (this suggestion is especially for mobile apps and use a hamburger-styled menu for desktopsbut this is not an option for jabref) and to use a grayish color for secondary navigation (ie our groups side panel) for an example see belowi would suggest @halirutan opens a pr with the unification of the colors and then everybody is invited to play around a bit and propose a theme maybe we could even ask our users for help and/or use 99desgins again (it shouldnt be too hard to load the css from an external resource to make it very easy for somebody to change the style without actually compiling jabref from source)![image]( || following up on what @koppor already said the """"search"""" feature is also the most important one to me i have a database with over 14000 entries - i wouldnt know what to do without the search feature so i think (at least for my use case) it deserves its prominent position i do agree with @halirutan however that the social media buttons appear less useful (again this might only apply to me)@tobiasdiez : i dont know whether this belongs here so apologies if it does not when using the search feature in:```jabref 42-dev--snapshot--2018-02-21--maintable-beta--58cfd7f48windows 10 100 amd64 java 180_161```the background colour is this darkish blue-purple colour the text that is inserted by the user in the search bar however is black which makes it very difficult to distinguish the text from the background colour this should definitely be changed to a bright colour e g white if the dark background colour is kept || i have by far not touched everything but i tried to at least use consistent colors i used the [canadian color scheme]( that i discovered recently through hacker news i used only one blue base-color and several grays all other colors are only for highlighting like selected rows warnings tooltips etcthe result is a very modern and friendly looking jabref in a flat design![jabrefcolors mp4 mp4]( all needs to be cleaned up and unified further but i cannot do this without help because some things (like the sidepanel) are created in code and other things seem to have no effect and i would like to understand what the intention behind it washere are some things i tried to tackle:- a hover effect for all flat buttons that do something- get a consistent height between the header of the side panel and the main table to make it more pleasing- use the base-color for most buttons selected tabs and the header in the maintable- get a good ratio between the gray-tones of the toolbars the background the content panes and the separators between the split-panes- for this test i removed the sidepanel icons they are far too much left and i guess their purpose is to remind the user how the icon in the toolbar looks :)in any-case with consistent styling we can create a girl version of jabref easily![girl]( || @halirutan i like the light and fresh look where exactly do you need help?

as soon as you know the jre version where jabref runs could you report this as an issue to the [ubuntu bug tracker]( you can try java8 and [the latest build]( i am afraid that this wont succeed toothe only thing that currently helps is to upgrade to oracles jre using the [oracle-java8-installer]( || at least 211 should also work with openjdk 8 - see #168 || as reported above i too use ubuntu 1510 and i have tried both the version in the repository (210) and the last stable version available (2111)- **version 210 using java 17 (openjdk)**: cannot test it because even if i change the default java from 18 to 17 system wide it uses java 18 (this should probably be a separate bug)- **version 210 using java 18 (openjdk)**: sometimes it hangs on the splashscreen sometimes it starts up and load the last file i edited but as soon as i try to click around or open another file it hangs (with no errors printed on the console except warnings such as """"could not get key binding for """"open folder"""""""")- **version 2111  (jar) using java 17 (openjdk)**: starts up and load the last file i edited but as soon as i try to do something like clicking around or opening another file it hangs- **version 2111  (jar) using java 18 (openjdk)**: starts up and load the last file i edited but as soon as i try to open another file it hangs (more precisely it hangs as i click on a folder in the standard java open file dialog window)so right now i dont know any trivial way of using jabref on the last version of ubuntuthanks paolo ||   have you tried it with oracle-jdk? || nope unfortunately i dont have time to install it (its not in the ubuntu repositories) nor to do other tests(anyway openjdk is the official reference implementation of java se so you should use it to develop jabref   ) || all current developers of jabref use windows i have not found an openjdk implementation that can be installed on windows do you have any pointers for us? || uh i wasnt aware that openjdk is only available for linux   so much for """"write once run everywhere""""still since i reckon linux is widely used by researchers i suggest you should pay more attention to its compatibility anyway thanks for the work you guys did and do on jabref: its a very useful piece of software   ill try to run it with oracle-jdk as soon as i can || the same problem has been happening to me today  ive just submitted a report to ubuntu bug tracker || hm you could try to run the jar via `java -jar jabrefjar` (jar can be downloaded directly from our mirrors) and then give us any stacktraces for debugging purposes  || no stacktraces nor errors get printedso as suggested [here]( i tried to run the jar (2111 with openjdk 7) and then get a thread dump using `jstack`i enclose two log files: one before it gets stuck and one after[jabref_jstack-beforetxt]( short after it gets stuck some thread in charge of painting some graphical component appears to be in blocked stateso it seems to me that this is a (major) bug of the gtk look&feel implementationbesides for the record recently i had similar problems with other java software such as freemind and netbeans || for the record [1520294]( is ubuntus bug number || in preferences -> advanced you could change the look and feel if you are able to get there maybe this helps  || indeed it works i switched to metallookandfeel restarted and it doesnt get stuck anymore (using any java version)great thanks for the hint!(maybe dont mark this as solved so that people with this problem can come here and read about the workaround - waiting for a proper fix) || fantastic!  just done the same and it works :-)  many thanks simon!ps please move jabref off sourceforge  it is so dodgy nowadays  || maybe we should change the default for linux based systems  || i was having a very similar problem  i tried lots of things in vane (i tried using `openjdk-6` `7` and `8` i tried doing `apt-get purge` on everything relating to java on my system and deleting `~/java` and then re-installing openjdk and jabref etc but jabref still crashed)  im on ubuntu 1510  before i found this bug report (ie before i saw that a work-around is to change to metallookandfeel) the one thing that i found to work was to edit `/etc/java-7-openjdk/accessibilityproperties` and comment out `assistive_technologiesorggnomeaccessibilityatkwrapper`  i just thought id mention this in case its useful for debugging!thanks to all the jabref devs  it really is a great bit of software!id definitely recommend keeping an eye on how well jabref works on linux  as others have said there are probably quite a few researchers who use linux pretty much exclusively (like me) || thank you for the nice words about jabref! as this is an open source project we do welcome help at the moment we are lacking a developer who uses linux as his main operating system :) ||  and developers using macs are also welcome and we would even accept help from people who are using windows    || and female developers (so """"her operating system"""" is also ok) || thanks for the work around of changing the look and feel i agree with others that it would be nice to have it work out of the box on linux again! it did take me some unproductive time trying to figure out what went wrong before i found this issue || for the record:jabref works out of the box on centos 67 kernel 2632-57331el6x86_64 gnome 2282java version """"180_65""""java(tm) se runtime environment (build 180_65-b17)java hotspot(tm) 64-bit server vm (build 2565-b01 mixed mode)not sure if this is pure luck (as i do not administer the computer myself)i think one problem here is that """"linux"""" is rather badly defined without knowing any details it appears as if the major source of the problem is that parts of openjdk are not thread-safe a patch is proposed that probably would solve the problem (since august) but openjdk is not keen on applying it || @oscargus what is the default look and feel used with this centos machine? || assuming that jabref reports the correct thing in the preference dialog (or is there a better way?): comsunjavaswingplafgtkgtklookandfeel || confirmed the look and feel value was the problem on ubuntu 1510:```openjdk version """"180_66-internal""""openjdk runtime environment (build 180_66-internal-b17)openjdk 64-bit server vm (build 2566-b17 mixed mode)```preferences should be in `~/java/userprefs/net/sf/jabref/prefsxml` there should be a key called lookandfeel with the gtk theme set (line 94) change the line to:`<entry key""""lookandfeel"""" value""""javaxswingplafmetalmetallookandfeel""""/>`or:`<entry key""""lookandfeel"""" value""""javaxswingplafmetalsynthlookandfeel""""/>`ps @oscargus the gtklookandfeel failed on ubuntu 1510 with `java 170_95` and `java 180_66` || @simonharrer you remember when we tried this in stuttgart togetehr with a student?

anything that would be of help || good to hear @jssander! the general aim is to convert these dialogs to the """"new"""" ui technology javafx while at the same time improving the user experience/work flow do you already have experience with javafx? i think the """"find unlinked files"""" dialog is a good first project the dialog is not too complex and reasonable well designed thus you can convert it more or less identically to javafx (personally i would move the """"select all/none"""" buttons below the file tree and remove the """"expand/collapse"""" buttons maybe use an accordion-like design to emphasize the 2-step structure of the dialog see eg [here]( or [here]( for code examples have a look at the dialogs """"options > manage journal abbreviations"""" or """"key bindings"""" and of course feel free to ask questions here or in gitter || hey @tobiasdiez i am new to this project but im learning javafx now and will start converting the dialogs  i will also take a look at the placement of the buttons that you mentioned || @gsweetwood nice to hear that you are interested in contributing to jabref! since @jssander expressed interest in converting the """"find unlinked files"""" dialog and he already has some experience with the code of this dialog it is probably best to leave this conversion to him (if you have not yet started)but you are lucky and there are still a few others dialogs that needs attention as a good start i would recommend the three dialogs under """"edit"""" (with the """"manage keywords"""" being the most complicated of those) || great thanks for the recommendation  ill start there || hey @tobiasdiez i noticed that the examples you gave (""""options > manage journal abbreviations"""") have controller view and view model classes  im working on  edit-> set/clear/append rename fields which is currently handled with just one class  do you want me to create the classes like the example or to just modify the existing class? || @gsweetwood yes please use the new separation in view and view model (often called mvvm pattern) more details can be found in our wiki:  in practice you can still reuse most of the logic (as part of the view model class) but often need to rewrite most of the view/controller(and please base your code on the maintable-beta branch there we made some major changes also to the structure - mainly merging the controller and the view)  @tobiasdiez @siedlerchr i hope this is a good place to post!  i am starting to rework the custom exporter dialog into javafx and i am starting by making the table  i looked at the manage journal abbreviations table (in mvvm) to see how to create and populate a table in javafx  but i canâ€™t seem to find where the tables are populated  i know lines 85-91 in `src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/journals/managejournalabbreviationviewjava` are related to populating the tables  are the abbreviations coming from the preferences?  is the population being done in managejournalabbreviationviewmodeljava?  is this similar to how it needs to be done in the custom exporter dialog?  help is appreciated  thanks!abe || @norwaymaple have a look at my open office pr    a table you need an extra viewmodel the data model which represents the data you want to show in the tableyou then would create an observable list with the data model objects and expose that property and bind it to the tablle || hello this would be the first contribution i make to an open source project  is there something youd suggest i do?  im also starting working with javafx but have a pretty good understanding of java || hey thanks for your interest you could transform the manage protected terms dialog to javafx you can create the layout with scene builder (the fxml) for some general information about dialogs with javafx have a look at our wiki the easiest way is to look at existing javafx dialogs feel free to ask any questions either in your pr then or in our gitter chat  || we have gone a long way and now the final last dialog to convert is push to application the settings this would be a great way to implement the proposal  in  however is an extra issue as it depends on the new layout of the entry editor || i have created a pr with some architecture tests to display where swing is still used  || "";1;0;fix display (still ugly);"

try to fix this one? || sure go ahead!  || helloi am a bit confused on the exact source of this error i read through the corresponding classes from the event-log but most issues should be caught only

and would throw an error any help would be appreciated  || thanks for investing this issue! my guess is that in  is null it is initialized in the constructor this happens on a different thread/async

|| @norwaymaple  depends on the word vocals can be either short or long  i think my pronunciation is more like dschapp-ref (literally) but in the end it doesnt matter pronounce it like you want as long as it works )  || i have two questions:1i read pull request #3092 and it seemed to say we are trying to move away from using `jabrefpreferences` and toward using separate preferences objects like `layoutpreferences` and `savepreferences` that can be passed into logic and model objects  should i be using different preferences objects as well rather than `jabrefpreferences`?2i am trying to move code out of `customexportlist` so that i can get rid of the class  as of now i have taken lines 91-102 in that class and largely put them (with modifications) into `jabrefpreferencesgetcustomexportformats` lines 2034-2046 and `createmodifyexporterdialogviewmodel` (my vm for the new subdialog for custom exporters) lines 80-91  i also need similar functionality in `exporterviewmodel` around line 17  to avoid the boilerplate processing of strings and filetypes in all three classes before instantiation of `templateexporter` which is in logic i was thinking of putting a new constructor into that class (which i started doing)  is this recommended?i can also spend more time reading methods that call `customexportlist` and methods in `templateexporter` tomorrow if youre not sure there is no general rule of thumb here i think if you have more than one preference for a dialog or whatever eg you have multiple preferences you acesss as with the timestamp prefs it is useful to have them grouped into one single preferences classps: you should merge master in and resolve the conflicts to stay up to date || @tobiasdiez @siedlerchr hi guysi just finished a minimal version of the dialog that works  it should be able to add modify remove and save custom exporters to preferences as well as load from preferencesthe major architectural change was that i removed `orgjabrefpreferencescustomexportlist` and put its functionality into `jabrefpreferences` and logic because i found the original class to be incompatible with mvvm architecture  the changes to logic were minimal and included changes to `templateexporter` and `standardfiletype` that allow more flexible inputs  through this i have simplified saving and loading from preferencestake a look and/or test it and let me know what you think  i can improve it by adding invalid input checks etc but as long as the user plays along it works so far  i also can make the list sorted alphabetically but i havenâ€™t yetyou may have to click the save button a few times for it to work - iâ€™m not sure why || as for those checks they were already implemented in that the dialog just returns an empty `optional` in those cases among others  the code is as follows:```        if (layoutfileget()isempty() || nameget()isempty() || extensionget()isempty()            || !layoutfileget()endswith(""""layout"""")) {            loggerinfo(""""one of the fields is empty or invalid!"""")            // return empty exporter to the main exporter customization dialog            return optionalempty()        }``` || sorry i closed the pr by mistake so i reopened it || @siedlerchr @tobiasdiez if it would be helpful i can go through the pr briefly on skype  that way i could go through the code with you step-by-step || @norwaymaple  sure you can add me in skype under siedlerkiller20 then we can make up a time for a call || pleas ressolve the l10n errors/conflicts || thank you both for your comments!  i will look into them soon  @siedlerchr would you still like to skype or do you think you have looked at the code enough?  i am glad to proceed either way || i think i am going to remove the `optional` as a parameter and make it nullable instead but its not a final decision anyway attached is the diagram as it the program stands _now_ (sorry its sideways - it was correctly oriented before i uploaded it)![ecd dialog flowchart]( || i made a number of the changes for some reason the cancel button is not showing up in the subdialog also i tried to use a try/catch block to catch an `indexoutofboundsexception` when `selectedexportersget(0)` is called on an empty list ie no exporters are selected however the exception doesnt get caught separately (but not pushed) i tried just doing a check for it `if (selectedexportersisempty()) {return}` but that led to the same uncaught exception || @siedlerchr @tobiasdiez i think i have finished the corrections you guys recommended do you think anything remains to be changed?thanksabe || i removed most of the comments - let me know if i need to remove the last few for the code formatter i ran it then `git reset --hard` and just removed some extra newlines (it wanted me to add indents that didnt make sense as well) thanks for your help! || "";;;;1;1;remove extra newlines;"

the comment states - shift on win or no modifier how would i differentiate between transfermodemove (without shift key pressed) and dragdropped behavior from preference option (as we want this to be read only when there no modifiers)?for the other two modes (link and copy) i was thinking to do an `or` with preference option but that would not be applicable for transfermodemove  || its probably not possible to differentiate between move  no modifier and move  shift thus i would suggest the following behavior:move -> do what is configured in preferences (default: move rename and link file)link -> link file except if preferences  link in this case move rename and linkcopy -> do what is configured in preferences (default: move rename and link file)in this way the user can configure the default action on windows and linux but is also possible to only link the file if he wants to || just need some clarification on the behavior for link i got that if the transfer mode is link then we should allow the user to link file but if the preference is set to link with link as the transfer mode then why should we move rename and link file? shouldnt we follow move rename and link when preference is set to move rename and link and not when it is set link? || i wasnt sure about this either my rationale was to allow for the following behavior:1 users selects """"move & rename"""" as default action:  - no modifier -> move & rename  - ctrl ( transfermodelink) -> link2 users selects """"link"""" as default action:  - no modifier -> link  - ctrl ( transfermodelink) -> move & renamebecause otherwise the users has no option to perform """"move & rename"""" if he selected """"link"""" as the default action but im very open for suggestions if this behavior is counter intuitive || i think your option is good but i just feel that it should be documented that what keys would be used for each option in preferences tab in brackets one more suggestion that we can consider is as follows:- pref  move        : shift or no modifier > move	: ctrl > copy 	: alt > link- pref  copy	: shift or no modifier > copy	: alt > link (alt is the """"default"""" key for linking so user has one less thing to remember)	: ctrl > move - pref  link	: shift or no modifier > link	: alt > move	: ctrl > copy (ctrl is the """"default"""" key for copying so user has one less thing to remember)let me know your thoughts on this || @shahamish150294  please be aware that the keys differ on other operating systems eg linux or mac and not all operating systems differ between all modifiers  see my code comment regarding ubuntu somewhere  || your suggestion looks good to mewhatever behavior we choose in the end it should be documented in the help and even better directly during the drag & drop action eg something like the following and replacing """"sposta"""" with the real action to be performed (but this is something for a new pr)( || i have added the logic we discussed above and  the linkedfileseditor to allow moving of the files within the file editor i also updated the issue on helpjabref to follow the behavior as we have discussed here for documentation || if @tobiasdiez  gives his okay we can merge this! || "";adding file to file field - automatically asking what to do?;i believe in some more or less distance past it was possible to drag and drop a file onto the entry editors file field and then jabref automatically asked what to do with the file eg automatically rename and store the file in the preferred folder (#4166)would be amazing if this too worked again );""we reworked drag and drop completely if you drop directly on the file field the file will be just linkedif you drop it elsewhere on the entry editor or preview panel it will be renamed and moved to the file directory if you drop on maintable jabref tries to create an entry and asks what to do || its somewhat strange that drop on file field is different from a drop on the rest of the entry editor i think this should be aligned (ie always rename + move + link) || i agree with the alignment but not that it must always rename+move+link i for one prefer to keep my files the way i have already named them and in the subfolders they are already in it could be a preference choice:""""when dropping a file on the entry editor do you wish to  a) only link (ie keep the file where it is and with its original name)b) rename and keep in locationc) rename+move+link""""something along those lines || so in fact we restore the dialog asking what to do || not necessarily if it is in options -> preferences then one chooses once and thats it || okay will think about t his:in the meantime we have the following options also avaiable:holding shift  and dragging or directly dropping without key on windows ->  move + rename + linkholding alt key on windows -> link file to entry keep in locationholding ctrl on windows -> copy files to file dir + link to entrythe modifiers are the system ones for move link and copy they are system dependent: || a preference option for the default action is a good idea in my opinion thanks @tb77phd for the suggestion || if anybody is not looking into this can i take this issue?

under the hood the bidirectional is nothing else than a wrapper around the changelistener stuff  || also note that its necessary to have a reference to `searchtext` property accessed under the changelistener for `searchbox` could this be related to some sort of premature garbage collection?edit: for me changing the text in the gui field did not update the view or highlight the labels || bindings are created using weaklistener so they might get garbage collected but i still dont understand why it works for me with the patch i would propose you test again with my patch or at least commit the changes and let others test as well unfortunately i am the next days busy at work and probably cant help much || okay i have pushed changes in the mean time i will try testing it again ps: since the `preferencessearchhandler` does not use the `searchtext` property but only the query text can we instead bind the `searchbox` to the `filtertabs` ie not have to deal with binding the text property and string property?

places: tab header heading and description text personally if i click on the """"related articles"""" tab i expect that i get a list of articles that are related to the currently selected one thus the heading and description dont add anything new`i agree that there is some redundancy in this -- at least right now however we plan to use different approaches to calculate document relatedness such as text-based (that is what we use now) but also eg citation-based actually we already use different text-based approaches consequently we expect the description to differ in the future (they are not hard-coded into jabref but dynamically created on our server) actually we already use different text-based approaches though i am not sure if the explanation will differ (i would have to double check this) generally it is widely accepted that explanations in recommender systems are important to create trust also even though """"related articles"""" may be redundant we would like to a/b test if there is any effect (positive or negative) when displaying this the same is true for the explanations (we want a/b test different variations including showing no explanations) > can you please explain the reason for this change if i understand the code correctly it now always send a """"received"""" and """"displayed"""" status message except for the case where mr dlib returned an error message (or there was a problem with the  request) in this case you probably better log the error on the server sideyes you understand the process correctly the reason is twofold first we would like some kind of confirmation because chances are that a user requests recommendations but before they are displayed the user leaves the """"related articles"""" tab in that case we currently have the log entry in our database that recommendations were delivered and we assume they were displayed (though they were not) however it is important to know whether recommendations were displayed to reliably calculate click-through rates second we would like to have a """"recommendation received"""" confirmation simply to have a chance to see if anything in jabref fails when processing/displaying the recommendations or to see if there is any notable delay it is not super important for us to have the """"received"""" confirmation but the """"displayed"""" confirmation would be very helpful bestjoeran || in line with stefans reply by mail in my opinion a/b tests for showing descriptions and/or headers is micro-optimatization but if you think that this improves the user experience in the long term then go for it it would be nice if you could share the data about the influence of these changes on the click rates(addendum: personally i see mr dlib as a service that provides the data about related articles and how to display these data falls in the sovereignty of jabref (as opposed to that mr dlib """"owns"""" the complete tab and its content) think of how the other fetchers wok: we ask google if it knows some articles that are matched by the users search query and then display the reported entries) concerning the `display` status update i have a stronger opinion in my opinion it over-complicates the code and i doubt you get meaningful data from it (it takes only a few houndred milliseconds to get a small  response from your server and display it i doubt that many people are leaving the tab that quickly even if they misclicked) what i can offer you as a compromise is that you include the mr dlib tab (as well as all other entry editor tabs) in our azure analytics telemetry (which we then would share with you of course) this would give you also more valuable information such as time spent in the mr dlib tab how many visits to this tab per users and per session etc || > it would be nice if you could share the data about the influence of these changes on the click ratesof course you can have a copy of all that data once we have it (and sooner or later we would publish the results anyway) > it takes only a few houndred milliseconds to get a small  response from your server and display itthis is unfortunately not the case recently recommendations take much longer because we did many changes to the recommendation algorithms these changes slow down the process but hopefully improve the relevance sometimes (actually quite often) it takes several seconds to return recommendations also we currently have an internship student who wants to add some new approach that would require an additional one or two seconds of computing time it would be important to know how long (most) users are willing to wait if most users are willing to wait 20 seconds perfect but if most users leave the tab after 2 seconds then we need to either upgrade our server or optimize our algorithms for speed  > include the mr dlib tab (as well as all other entry editor tabs) in our azure analytics telemetry (which we then would share with you of course) this would give you also more valuable information such as time spent in the mr dlib tab how many visits to this tab per users and per session etcthat would be very interesting information thank you though it wouldnÂ´t fully help with the outlined problem i guess? the azure statistics couldnÂ´t tell us how many users left the related-article tab before recommendations were displayed right?  || how do we proceed here? shall we remove the received and displayed confirmation (or only one of it) and keep the other changes? || sorry forget to answer> though it wouldnÂ´t fully help with the outlined problem i guess? the azure statistics couldnÂ´t tell us how many users left the related-article tab before recommendations were displayed right?with azure you can track whatever events you are interested in so if this information is really valuable to you you can add an event for """"recommendations tab opened"""" and one for """"recommendations shown"""" that should give you a valid basis to gauge whether the recommendation creation takes too much time || > so if this information is really valuable to you you can add an event for """"recommendations tab opened"""" and one for

do i need to get an equal or greather percent? || you can ignore the code coverage and the dependency update testcodacy is sometimes a bit difficult as for some fxml stuff it is generating false positives (eg marking functions as unused but does not take into account that these are defined in fxml)we are generally not so focused on code coverage but prefer tests for the most important model/logic functionality  || by the way i have forgotten to say that this code keeps the associated shortcuts because those choices are also in the right-click menu || @tobiasdiez i am sorry for being late in answering your questions here are my thoughts on why i moved the items/features you mentioned:1 _replace string_: i do think that the the main difference between this feature and _manage keywords_ is the possibility to change a string in all entries and not just selected ones meaning the scope of the function separates it from the other items in _edit_additionally replacing a string is not bound to a field like _mangage keywords_ or _rank entry_ therefore it has a more general purpose i would arguehowever i agree that it does not completely fit into the _tools_ tab as well moving it there was a try to give the function more exposure because many users did not know about the _tools_ tab is a central part of the users workflow which is why i chose that tabthe name change for the feature is great i think because it matches the name of the same feature in other programs2 _set/clear/rename/append fields_: i proposed to move this feature to library because i thought that the four functions it contains had a global effect on all entries i have noticed that this was a misunderstanding on my part so i will have another look at the featurebut i still think that the feature as a whole does not fit the _edit_ tab because of the """"rename"""" part renaming is not really a content change and it has more complex implications for an entry if the renaming function was split from the rest keeping it in _edit_ seems appropriate3 _find unlinked files_: while _set file links_ does only improve the quality of existing entries by associating a file this feature is a bit more versatile it can also help to find files in a folder which do not even have a bibliography entry yet and can even be used to extract bibliographic information from a pdf i think that the ways of using this feature go beyond qa measures which is why i proposed to move it4 _new sublibrary based on aux file_: i think that you are right in regard to this function being an export function and that it could be moved to _export_ as well then it would have to be renamed though into something like """"export entries cited in aux file"""" however export has the connotation of some change in the data format which is not really the case with this feature because it only creates a subset of the current bibliography i found the _library_ tab appropriate because the feature is bound to the active library and therefore """"depends"""" on it (and an aux file)i think all four points are up to discussion and depend on the view of the individual this is why i think that especially the grouping of items in the main menu would profit from more user data to have a more objective center in that discussion || thanks @martinkarim for your detailed explanation! that clarifies a lot for me and im fine with these changes for the sake of moving forward with this pr i would propose to- rename """"replace string"""" to """"find and replace""""- move """"new sublibrary based on aux file"""" to """"tools""""as part of this pr and then merge @davidemdot could you please implement these changes?

entries total so far however it takes jabref as long as 10 minutes to open up a database file just a few moments ago i loaded a database with just 12 entries i went and made coffee came back wrote an e-mail and then logged onto github to post this request for help before jabref came upim not sure what i need to change or what the issue is i cant imagine everyone is experiencing this kind of performance i would expect people would stop using the software if this was normal so i dont know if this is a bug in what i have or a setting thats incorrect but any help on this would be greatly appreciated additionally i use a dual screen system in whatever screen jabref loads up in it works (once it loads) however when i drag the window over to the other screen the jabref window goes completely black and becomes inoperable it works when i drag it back to the first screen;""a further note that may be relevant whenever i open a bib file i get the message """"a back for xbib was

performance and other fixes || i downloaded the development version this did help the issue but not very much what i am finding is that if i click on the jabref icon it loads in about 30 seconds to a minute i can then click on file-> open library ->appropriate file and that file will load up instantly however if i click a bib file outside of jabref it takes a very long time for jabref to come up  || the backups issue is actually worse now whenever i open a file i get the """"a back up was detected do you want to restore from the back up"""" message however after i click no the same message will sometime randomly reappear later and will also cause additional jabref windows to keep popping up as i am writing this ive actually had to close 3 jabref windows that popped up just while i was writing this comment  || @mazerrackhem  first of all you can manually delete the backup files they are next to your bib files the *sav and *bak file  jabref usually asks if the instance was not shut down correctlyyou can also disable the auto save feature in the settings which may sometimes cause this effectstarting jabref may take some time depending on your last opened bib files we are working on this #4578 so you might wait a time or disable the option """"open last bib files at startup"""" in the settingsanother known issue you might encounter is that jabref is currently unable to detect an already running instance so you may have accidentally started multiple instances of jabref  || thanks for your response siedlerchr i am trying to take the suggestions you have offered however i cannot find a settings tab in the current 50 version under """"options"""" i see """"preferences"""" however when i click on preferences a status in the bottom of the jabrref window says """"status: opening preferences"""" but does not actually open up preferences i waited on it for around 5 minutes before giving up am i missing the settings somewhere else?as a point of reference i timed the start up of jabref today it took 5 minutes 11 seconds to open after being clicked on from the desktop there was 1 library file open at the time it was closed last night which opened with it  || no you did all right are you using a mac? some mac users reported problems with jabref as well you might try this:  || no im on a windows 10 machine  || as @siedlerchr has not made this clear imho: loading times like the ones you report are faaaaaaar from being normal a database file with some hundreds of entries is usually loaded within 1-3 seconds so there must be something terribly wrong herea wild

above is related to the instance detection of a potential second jabref instance this is a known bug which has not yet been  regarding the proxy: have you tried specifying the proxy as parameter to

@samiyac sorry for the late answer i think it is slightly better to relativize the path only in the group dialog ie after the user selected a file via the browse button in this way the relatization is transparent to the user and codewise you dont run into the problems that you describe aboveit would be nice if you could add tests for the basic things (serialization/parsing/making paths relative) but you are not required to cover everything || @tobiasdiez i have implemented that the only problem is that when i am saving my aux file i am saving relative path so when i parse to create texgroup i need access to latexfiledirectory which i can only get through metadata || thanks to @samiyac this is now implemented in the latest development version could you please check the build from  thanks! please remember to make a backup of your library before trying-out this version || "";1;0;delete irrelevant code;"

i noticed this behaviour before but as far as i remember you get the correct numbers of items contained in a group if you save your database then close jabref and then reopen the database in jabrefthis is still obviously a bug but a less serious one i guess - it is basically the updating process of the groups panel that does not work properly (which i think is also responsible for some other issues we see with the groups panel) || sometimes the number update if you switch to another db and then back again  || @siedlerchr however on switching to another library group count shows count of previous libraryi am looking into this issue right now what i have found is that when the database is changed a new instance of the `integerproperty hits` is created each time [[1]]( and `text` (representing gui for the number of hits) is being bound to this newly created instance [[2]]( therefore the binding does not prove useful herethe `text` should still be updated with the value of `hits` anyway but it turns out that the binding of `hits` to `text` is done before `hits` is updated it is because of another binding [[3]]( which internally triggers a callback to `viewmodeltreetablecellfactory`this results in `text` holding previous value of `hits` and not the current onewhen jabref starts up there are some initial calls made which have`hits` initialized to 0 and `text` binds to that until database is changed   || thanks for investigating this issue this is how it is supposed to work:- whenever a library gets the focus convert the group tree to a tree of `groupnodeviewmodel`s bind the value of the `hit` property to the text field whenever there are changes to the library update the hit count (which should then propagate to the text label through the above binding) it sounds reasonable that there is a problem with the binding of the text label to the correct hits property || @tobiasdiez i think the problem might actually be concerned with `databasecontextgetdatabase()getentries()addlistener(this::ondatabasechanged) `i added a print statement inside the function `ondatabasechanged` and it didnt print anything after a few entries were addedthe problem is related to this:  would solve issue 4679]( i think this issue might have more to do with the group being utilized in the line `texttextproperty()bind(groupgethits()asstring())` is the older group this causes value to not be set properly but i think this happens only if the only group you have is all entries || @tobiasdiez and @siedlerchr why do we have the all entries group available when no library has been opened in jabref? it doesnt seem to serve any function || you are right the """"all entries group"""" should only be shown when there is an open library || the value should also be updated if the library is closed which also does not happen right now || see  will probably fix both of the issues || this should be  in the latest development version could you please check the build from  thanks! please remember to make a backup of your library before trying-out this version || jabref 50-dev--snapshot--2019-09-16--master--1bec5efd3windows 10 100 amd64 java 1104-bellsoftas far as i can tell this issue appears to be fixed in the current developer version of jabref thank you very much!what i do note however is that assigning articles to new groups creates a massive cpu workload (always around 95%-100% cpu workload on a 6-core core i7) this cpu workload takes several minutes to disappear i do not know however whether this issue is related to the current fix or if it is just related to the general performance problems that jabref has at the moment (see  || follow-up: note also that the group entry count number is updated immediately when an item is assigned to a new group but the colour indicating the group assignment is not the colouring of the group affinities is only updated if you select another item in the main table or another group in the panel and then re-select the newly assigned itemas you can see this is not a major issue but i wanted to report it (see also here:  || thanks for the feedback ill try to improve the performance in the coming weeks but first i wanted to fix as much bugs as possible please open another issue for the coloring problem || i just realised that i had reported the colouring issue before see here: (similar but not the same) here: you very much for your continuous work on jabref! || @aegit did you encounter by chance this issue after the latest fix?

repository? the helpfile of my v30 install is not getting past the second page and  is the old informationthis maybe should be a forum post"";""yes all support for these things is terminated you can put multiple file links into the `file` field of a bibtex entry you just need to separate the path via a semicolon || thanks lenhard:-( i am not referring to having multiple files linked in the file field i was asking after the additional paths to directory locations other than set in options>preferences>external programs""""main file directory"""" that the  """"main pdf directory:"""" and """"main ps directory:"""" settings allowed (very handy even though not their intended purpose) can you please contirm your reply means that **i have to apply the full file specification from the root** for the thousand+ files i have in my separate endnote directory (outside the """"main file directory"""")  am i missing something? || im not sure whether i understand your use case correctly you have used the """"legacy fields"""" `pdf` / `ps` to define file links which are based outside your set """"main file directory""""?so your entries have both: a file field **and** a pdf/ps field pointing relatively to different files (in different folders)?if so then you cannot retain this behavior with jabref 30+or do you have only the pdf/ps field **but no additional file link**? so what you basically want is to define database specific """"main directories"""" which are used for relative linking? if so you should use the functionality to define a database specific main directory accessible via right-click on the database title tab -> """"database properties"""" || maybe paste a small excerpt of your bib file here as this may clarify things  || @ajbelle bump || sorry for delayed reply gentlemen @matthiasgeiger   thanks for your hint ---> accessible via right-click on the database title tab -> """"database properties"""" it is the closest to my case however i can only get jabref to access the files in a single base directory i enter here rather than across multiple base file directories (folders on my win7 hard drive) simultaneously if i complete both fields jabref only accesses the user specific file directory:!i insert the bib file  fields (@simonharrer) so you can see that there are only single relative file links against each bibtex entry i dont have multiple files for each entry for this test filefrom the bib file :   entry calling from base directory e:\jabref_library     file                      {:Â°paper\Â°cfd\Â°les\leveque2007a- shear improved smagorinsky modelpdf:pdf}           --- from totally bibtex separate entry below -------------   entry calling from base directory e:\crc share\endnote\data\pdf\     file

 @comment{jabref-meta: filedirectory-abelle-ltn-amc-18ql102 \crc share\endnote\data\pdf\}this does _not_ replicate the behaviour that jabref provides with the legacy fields (that are still present in my preferences as set through legacy fields by an older jabref version)  from exported jabref_preferencesxml file:           <entry key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/>           <entry key""""psdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/>the above preferences make jabref search both the default and the legacy base directory locations for file links that within the bibtex file provide no indication of their different directory locations this is what i meant by a heterogeneous file structure the current jabref version seems to expect a single base directory location for all pdf files i could provide a directory link/mount (within the windows file system) to the second â€˜base directoryâ€™ so that jabref did not have to search both paths (the second one containing the imported endnote pdfs) i donâ€™t know how to but this is the simple and singular capability that my â€˜misuseâ€™ of the legacy directory fields providedonce again sorry if i am missing something || the `pdf` field is used by some people to have notes on the paper in a different file and to have two columns in the entry table: one for the notes and one for the pdf see message by guido milanese for details:  || @koppor i can see others would use this but it is completely the reverse requirement i have identified which is a single relative file reference within by jabrefbib file entry that is searched for by jabref in two root directories without having to provide the complete file spec for the second repository root directory this is a very useful capability that seems lost in the current jabref revision and presumably could be resurrected as a new jabref feature if in the background as the """"legacy pdf directory"""" being rebadged the """"alternative repository root directory"""" i believe it is just an alternative search path added to the file search specification because my configuration file already has the """"legacy pdf directory"""" included it still works for me at the moment but not if the jabref â€˜back endâ€™ terminates what the â€˜front endâ€™ already hasthe ability @koppor mentions no longer is available because it is â€˜front endâ€™ program changes that were implemented in the revision there are probably other users that are unaware they have the issue i have raised because their files in their files in legacy locations are still found while the â€˜back endâ€™ is left alone || so if i understand you correctly you want to specify more then one folder in `database properties -> general (or user specific) file directory` right?moreover if both the general and the user specific path are specified then also both paths should be searched (currently only the user specific folder is taken into account)  || @tobiasdiez yes you take is absolutely correct the very singular ability to add a â€œuser specified directoryâ€ that is searched if the pdf (or other) file is not found in the """"main file directory"""" specified jabref did this perfectly for me (by my miss-using the legacy pdf and ps directories setting) |jabref ver210|<options>preferences>external programs """"legacy pdf directory:"""" and """"legacy ps directory:"""") so it should not be a major recoding to reintroduce the """"legacy pdf directory"""" renamed the """"alternative pdf file directory""""  if a user could add more than one """"alternative file directory"""" to the search file path it would make jabref handling of heterogeneous repositories more flexible and a real strength  at the moment it still works for me because the jabref_preferencesxml file still contains:<entry key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/><entry key""""psdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/>this means that |jabref ver30| still lets my install find the files with the alternative root locations if nothing else could  the ability to load the above via |jabref|<options>preferences>import preferences>â€™jabref_preferencesâ€™xml be retained so i can still access this great capability (via the remaining back end support) || >  so it should not be a major recoding to reintroduce the """"legacy pdf directory"""" renamed the """"alternative pdf file directory""""its not that easy """"legacy pdf directory"""" refers to the """"legacy pdf field"""" in the bib file - which stores the information in a field named `pdf` - those fields have been removed as all files regardless of the type are stored in the field `file` (not since 3x but since earlier 2x versions) we decided to drop support for this legacy field (and therefore also drop support for the directory configuration for those fields)personally i dont like to introduce the additional configuration ability to add another """"pdf directory"""" - the current configuration possibilities should be enough for (almost  ) every use casewhy is this enough? a) this is absolutely no issues if absolute paths are used - so one strategy is to use those (which might not possible if you want to use the on different machines but:)b) you can use relative paths starting from the directory of the bibfile - so if you use similar folder structures on different machines your use case is still working (drawback moving the bib file around in the file system does not work)c) as a last fall back you can use the general and the database-specific folders (of course the bug that only folder is searched must be resolved!)but i will put this onto the agenda of our next dev call - perhaps the other developers have another opinion || thanks @matthiasgeiger for listing the alternative options as i understand option a) would require me to alter thousands of file links i pulled in from an endnote repository which for my skill level is daunting option b) would break my endnote access to the files (i think) option c) doesnt work at the moment but would suffice for my case if it did it is interesting that docear (that embeds jabref as is bibliographic manager) is looking for ways to provide just such multi directory capabilityi realise it was dropping support for field named pdf in the bib file that has withdrawn the need for  """"legacy pdf directory"""" and i make no suggestion to resurrect it the existing functionality within the back end of jabref to access the alternative repository is still in place however (it still is working for me as explained) so my comment about """"not be a major recoding"""" was because i thought it was a simple matter of writing the file name """"alternative file directory"""" from a settings field into the key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""the directory location spec""""i can still do this using |jabref ver30|preferences>import preferences>â€™jabref_preferencesâ€™xml          <entry key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""the directory loction spec""""/>          <entry key""""psdirectory"""" value""""the directory loction spec""""/>i saw this capability as a great feature provided by simply rebadging the key with no suggestion of reprogramming legacy support as usual i must be missing something and hope that this key""""pdfdirectory"""" is not deleted or my system (and i suspect others) will be brokenthx for all your time and great work and wish i had the skill to program it myself :-) i realise you are all heavily loaded and will leave it to your wisdomps: i did manage yesterday to get symbolic links running on my windos box so personally that is my fallback option d)  if the above functionality is taken out of the backend :-) i can send you my self-instructions on how i made symbolic links work  on win7 if it isnt seen as """"how to suck eggs"""" to a programmer as it is very easy once you implement it || interesting that it still works :-) i checked the code and it is not really obvious why (but then i have no idea how it worked earlier either)""""pdfdirectory"""" is only accessed when upgrading from an older version and when drag-and-dropping a pdf (this is probably not wanted by the way) fieldname + """"directory"""" is accessed in a few more places and might still add the possibility to introduce specific directories for each filetype no idea how it works though || thanks @oscargus for your checking and all others who helped:-)all i can confirm is that my repository as it stands links to  thousands of files from and endnote repository that i connected originally using the legacy pdf field (or at least that is how i thought i made it work) the entries in my bib file appear thus:legacy endnote entry eg:  file  {://z2 a summary of exp/z2 a summary of exppdf:pdf}entry in main file directory eg:  file   {:Â°paper\Â°misc\fisher1942g- geff and muttpdf:pdf}both are located within their respective directories that originate a different roots on the same partition (neither is a subdirectory of the other and there are no links known to me) there is nothing related that i can find in my system or user variables on win7i now have my fall-back option d) above so wonâ€™t waste more of your valuable time on this one i remain concerned that others may have similar working hetrogenous file structures that may break if future jabref revisions and hope it is just some setting on my instal that provides me this great functionality (i only install the latest jabref without uninstalling so perhaps that is why it still works) i give up:-( || @ajbell your """"legacy endnote entry"""" should be `pdf ` shouldnt it? would it be possible that you send me a mail with your complete entry? i will keep it private e-mail is on my github page refs #98 you did not symlink every file did you?    ||  no @koppor  i am on a billious gatus windoze7 box and only found out how to do symlinks after my original post now i can create them this issue is no longer a problem for me and i conclude symlinks are the sensible way forward for everyone (as it always probably was if bg-doze wasnt so retrograde) as stated previously i have never used the legacy `pdf ` field  in the """"main file directory"""" location  an entry looks as follows:`file   {:Â°paper\\Â°cfd\\Â°bl\\Â°rans\\gorle2012a-epistemic uncertaintypdf:pdf}`as requested i paste below a compete entry from my bib (jabref) file that accesses the  legacy collection it appears equivalent in all respects i use the Â° to distinguish directories i create that must not be moved/deleted/changed but these do not appear in the legacy directory structure  it is access to a legacy collection at a different root location i have been asking about (which my install clearly does as the root directory accessed in the examples given are different) not the legacy `pdf` field within a bib file entry ```@article{meynart1980aequa  title                     {equal velocity fringes in a rayleigh-benard flow by speckle method}  author                    {meynart r}  journal

provide the directory access i experiencei hope this clarifies any remaining question and sorry i havent been able to make it clearer :-(  judging by your responses i have set something up somewhere many years ago that provides access to the different root directory locations without realising it but it is not in my system variables or any directory linking that i can find i have clearly misunderstood that it was the `<entry key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/>` in the confiuration file allowing the access thankyou everyone for all you time and effort || for your interest yesterday i moved the old endnote repository into single location (not the main file directory in jabref) because it was buried deep in deep chain of directories and contained many links to a separate directory using files specs that absolute referenced to the disk root outcome: it worked using the method outline above of importing the new directory settings  `<entry key""""pdfdirectory"""" value""""e:\crc share\endnote\cavitationx1data\pdf\""""/>` using `|jabref|preferences>import preferences>â€™jabref_preferencesâ€™xml`  this is contrary to @oscargus findings because it did not work until i reset the redundant field using the still existent back door has anyone else tried to replicate this capability? it seems such a nice bonus ability for no programming effort || "";1;0;duplicate check on import should be run in background #4963;"

anything that would be of help || good to hear @jssander! the general aim is to convert these dialogs to the """"new"""" ui technology javafx while at the same time improving the user experience/work flow do you already have experience with javafx? i think the """"find unlinked files"""" dialog is a good first project the dialog is not too complex and reasonable well designed thus you can convert it more or less identically to javafx (personally i would move the """"select all/none"""" buttons below the file tree and remove the """"expand/collapse"""" buttons maybe use an accordion-like design to emphasize the 2-step structure of the dialog see eg [here]( or [here]( for code examples have a look at the dialogs """"options > manage journal abbreviations"""" or """"key bindings"""" and of course feel free to ask questions here or in gitter || hey @tobiasdiez i am new to this project but im learning javafx now and will start converting the dialogs  i will also take a look at the placement of the buttons that you mentioned || @gsweetwood nice to hear that you are interested in contributing to jabref! since @jssander expressed interest in converting the """"find unlinked files"""" dialog and he already has some experience with the code of this dialog it is probably best to leave this conversion to him (if you have not yet started)but you are lucky and there are still a few others dialogs that needs attention as a good start i would recommend the three dialogs under """"edit"""" (with the """"manage keywords"""" being the most complicated of those) || great thanks for the recommendation  ill start there || hey @tobiasdiez i noticed that the examples you gave (""""options > manage journal abbreviations"""") have controller view and view model classes  im working on  edit-> set/clear/append rename fields which is currently handled with just one class  do you want me to create the classes like the example or to just modify the existing class? || @gsweetwood yes please use the new separation in view and view model (often called mvvm pattern) more details can be found in our wiki:  in practice you can still reuse most of the logic (as part of the view model class) but often need to rewrite most of the view/controller(and please base your code on the maintable-beta branch there we made some major changes also to the structure - mainly merging the controller and the view)  @tobiasdiez @siedlerchr i hope this is a good place to post!  i am starting to rework the custom exporter dialog into javafx and i am starting by making the table  i looked at the manage journal abbreviations table (in mvvm) to see how to create and populate a table in javafx  but i canâ€™t seem to find where the tables are populated  i know lines 85-91 in `src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/journals/managejournalabbreviationviewjava` are related to populating the tables  are the abbreviations coming from the preferences?  is the population being done in managejournalabbreviationviewmodeljava?  is this similar to how it needs to be done in the custom exporter dialog?  help is appreciated  thanks!abe || @norwaymaple have a look at my open office pr    a table you need an extra viewmodel the data model which represents the data you want to show in the tableyou then would create an observable list with the data model objects and expose that property and bind it to the tablle || hello this would be the first contribution i make to an open source project  is there something youd suggest i do?  im also starting working with javafx but have a pretty good understanding of java || hey thanks for your interest you could transform the manage protected terms dialog to javafx you can create the layout with scene builder (the fxml) for some general information about dialogs with javafx have a look at our wiki the easiest way is to look at existing javafx dialogs feel free to ask any questions either in your pr then or in our gitter chat  || we have gone a long way and now the final last dialog to convert is push to application the settings this would be a great way to implement the proposal  in  however is an extra issue as it depends on the new layout of the entry editor || i have created a pr with some architecture tests to display where swing is still used  || "";1;0;removed unused import;"

the latest development version from  and the problem persists<!-- add a clear and concise description of what the bug is -->steps to reproduce the behavior:1 connect to postgresql db with â‰ˆ3400 entries2 see that it takes over 8 minutes the database has still not loaded completely this is on a very fast server the internet connection from here is only about 1 mb/s download however loading the same bibtex file off a shared drive from the same server takes only a few seconds saving my 3400 entries to the remote database also took hours and hours and jabref consumed something like 8 gb of memory while doing thiswould it be worth trying a mysql db instead?<!-- if applicable add excerpt of the bibliography file screenshot and excerpt of log (available in the error console) --><details>  <summary>log file</summary>    ```  paste an excerpt of your log file here  ```</details>;""i also have long processing times with a smaller database of about 600 entries about half an hour to paste 600 entries to the remote postgresql db when creating the tables then it takes about 2 min to open itthis occurs on both versions 431 and 382 || i am interested in working on this issue to recreate the problem i could set up a test postgresql database on heroku (a paas ive used before) and fill it with bibtex entries with a script then i could try to load the entries as described is there anything i should know before getting started? || we have some database related tests they might be a good starting point  i would wait until  is merged this pr already improves the db performance and maybe this fixes this issue as well || any other issues i can work on? i wanted to take a break from javafx but if theres not a strong need i can work on the importer dialog feel free to move this conversation to gitter || i think there may be two issues related to the db requests:  - single requests can be quite slow and make the user wait solution: speed can be improved or it could be an idea to let the user continue using jabref before requests end  - some operations seem to generate many db requests: they could be grouped to be sent as a single requestregarding the second point these operations seem to be concerned (from what i have tested):  - opening the remote db  - pasting or deleting multiple entries at once  - pasting a bibtex source that contains several fields || unfortunately this issue is known the synch is done way too many times i think there should be one or more duplicate issues for this already || i played around with python (using the psycopg2 library) to access my jabref (postgresql) database remotely i have â‰ˆ4000 entries but i was surprised how blazingly fast this went via python getting all keys or all filenames of attached pdfs or all group information for all entries â€” it all happened within very few seconds or even fractions of a second this compares to minutes that many jabref operations take this definitely gives me an idea that there is a lot of room for improvementmy requests pulled many entries from the db at once rather than doing many individual reads not sure if its of any help here and i really dont have much experience with databases at all but i thought id mention it || @schniepp is it problem still exist? || issue should still persist || @norwaymaple do you want to work on it?  || @ali96kz im looking into this how do i find the keystore i need? do you recommend i use something along the lines of `keytool -genkey`? || @schniepp @stefan-kolb are you sure the issue still exists in the latest development version? if im not mistaken @ali96kz recently implemented some huge improvements to the performanceit would be nice if you could try out the [latest development version]( before @norwaymaple invests time in trying to fix it  for me tests on the latest windows built with a remote postgresql server show the problem described in the issue is solved but there are still many actions that remain slow:- opening a db: now fast (a few seconds for a few hundreds of entries)- editing a field: still slow as i type the first character (~5 s) a bit faster for the second character then it gets faster and good as i continue typing- pasting in the bibtex tab an entry containing several fields: still very slow (1-2 min)- switching tabs: takes a few seconds || connecting to a remote postgresql db with â‰ˆ3900 entries took 30 seconds for jabref to show the entries in the windowexporting the same database as a *bib file and opening this file from the same server (via mounted network share) using the same network connection took exactly the same time: 30 seconds so in response to my original problem this is definitely a huge improvement! thank you so much! it is well usable now! i apologize for my late response as i have been totally overloaded at work || is this issue still needing work? i left off trying to connect jabref to an external postgres and debugging a error relating to a root certificate || @norwaymaple  regarding the cert stuff have a look here:  here for the server side: || btw  can someone of you working with the shared databse reproduce this issue? #4804 || @siedlerchr thanks for the links basically when i try to connect jabref says it cannot find `/users/abe/postgresql/rootcrt` but i dont have a directory `/users/abe/postgresql` and i have set environmental variable `$pghome` is set to somewhere else || @norwaymaple there are still the slowdowns mentioned in my previous comment @schniepp have you tried in your tests doing other tasks than just opening the database? in particular anything that writes on the db would be interesting if these write-related problems should be considered as a separate issue i can open one || @siedlerchr i looked at the page on setting up the postgres ssl client and it looks like it is not using """"javas default mechanism"""" for connecting to ssl that uses keystores but rather `libpqfactory` which is part of postgress jdbc driver what is this """"default mechanism"""" and how do i use it? || hm i could get it to work under windows by following the steps at the bottom of the page eg generate a key for the keystore and in jaref select the keystore regarding the location of the certs:have you tried connecting with [pgadmin]( to your db and then editing the configuration? screenshots are from pgadmin3( || it seems to be able to connect without certificates on pgadminwhen you connect to the postgres database from jabref do you know what driver is being used? mine implements libpq which apparently does not use keystores || @siedlerchr would it be possible for you to run my version at  i added the line `drivermanagersetlogwriter(new printwriter(systemout))` to write debug logs from `drivermanager` to standard outwhen you connect to the database using this version what is printed to standard out that does not go through jabrefs logger? for me it is the

moresqlstate(08006)getconnection failed: orgpostgresqlutilpsqlexception: could not open ssl root certificate file /users/abe/postgresql/rootcrt```let me know so i can see why it is working in your environment and not mine || okay tested again works fine: postgres 10xseems like your path to the file is not setup correctly  if you overwrite the path settings like i did then it should work otherwise it will load the default files from ~postgres ```drivermanagergetconnection(""""jdbc //localhost:5432/jabref"""")    trying commysqlcjjdbcdriver    trying orgpostgresqldrivergetconnection

change them when disconnected)![grafik]( also uploaded you my certs fileno password for the filesdefault connection postgres:postgres[certspostgreszip]( || are you referring to the postgres url by """"path to the file""""? how did you overwrite the path settings? || postgres apparently looks for the certificate files in the home folder per defaultin pgadmin you can adjust the server properties regarding ssl and specify the paths to the certificate files thats what i meant with overwriting file directory as you can see from my screenshot i put all certs in one folder and then i adjusted the server properties to point to that folder(im running postgres on same machine as jabref)  || @norwaymaple @siedlerchr: if you have issues setting up a database you can use a third party service for which there is little manual configuration to do for tests i think thats good enough i have just tried [elephantsql]( with their free 20 mb plan and it just takes 5 min to get it to work with jabref (and it shows similar slowdowns as my previous tests) || i considered elephantsql for the database but i had wanted to use heroku because i have used it for other things beforeon a side note when i turn the internet switch off on my computer i get a different error that says i cant connect so it must be at least trying to set up ssl with the remote server the exception is being thrown at  i dont see how this error could _not_ be thrown unless you have the root certificate in `$home/postgresql/rootcrt` or `%appdata%\postgresql\rootcrt` or have `sslrootcert` set in the properties (see  jabref does not set that property so far as i can tell (see below)  || i tried using elephantsql and the same error arose i checked my filesystem for `rootcrt` and didnt come up with anything would you be able to check your `${userhome}/postgresql/` in *nix systems or `%appdata%/postgresql/` for windows and let me see if your `rootcrt` is there? also i added more logging to the branch at my fork when you connect to the database using the version at  what is printed to standard out that does not go through jabrefs logger? || @norwaymaple  are you sure you have put the rootcrt on the **server** file system? || i have not how would i generate that file? i can also look into how i would put it onto the serveras a side note i am currently in the process of trying to install openssl on my macos in order to create a self-signed certificate it has been difficult because i have tried to install from the tarball and it may be interfering with another `openssl` binary from an anaconda distribution i installed separately || @norwaymaple  i think that you are missing the certs on your server: you need to either generate them on the server side or upload them using ftp/scp or whatever you have problems generating them you can use mine:[certspostgreszip]( || i think i figured out what the problem with trying to connect jabref to heroku postgres is it works out that heroku does not negotiate with ca-verifiable certificates but the postgres jdbc wants to connect with `sslmode` set to `verify-full` i am going to try another database || ive looked into this in the context of deleting ~50 entries from a shared database am i mistaken that they are deleted one by one with ~50 database queries? it looks like `orgjabreflogicshareddbmssynchronizerlisten(entryremovedevent event)` is run ~50 times could that explain why this and other operations are so slow? || i am not familiar enough with the jabref source to determine what it does but i can look from the other side of the tunnel and log what queries are made to my postgresql server here are a log attachments corresponding to various tasks i performed on jabref 431**click on an entry place cursor somewhere in the title field and insert a character**[insert_1_charactertxt]( generates nine single statements and one `begin  commit` block!**click on an entry place cursor somewhere in the title field and type quickly 10 characters**[insert_10_characterstxt]( spits out a log of 210 lines! it does 10 times what was done for a single character**pasting 4 entries copied from a local jabref database**[pasting_4_entriestxt]( each entry and for each field a statement is executed to set the value! some extra statements are also present when switching from one entry to another**deleting 4 entries**[deleting_4_entriestxt]( are deleted one by one using several statements for each**creating a new article entry go to the bibtex tab and paste a bibtex entry**[add_empty_article_and_paste_bibtextxt]( field is set one by one and using many statements**general observations**there are many occurences of```statement: select 1::char```and```execute <unnamed>: select * from """"metadata""that may not be useful**conclusion**in all the cases above changes could be made using less statements@norwaymaple this answers part of your question: from my logs we can extrapolate that deleting 50 entries executes 50*7 statements ||  and now the same tests but with install jabref_windows-x64_5_0-dev--snapshot--2019-07-14--master--7561724b1exe:[insert_1_character_devtxt]( statements are a bit different but most of the comments in my previous post still hold: changes are not grouped into less statements and there are unnecessary queries || yeah i think as your analysis uncovered as well is the problem is that jabref generates a change event for each typed char a so called fieldchangeevent which is then send to the db as a statement @tobiasdiez  do you see any way to only send an even when the field is left?i think we had this before we changed the entry editor stuff  sql statements are build here: || would it also help to make it so insertions and deletions of multiple entries are executed in batches? || @bruot thanks a lot for the in-depth analysis that helps a lot! @siedlerchr  || im still looking into this it looks like events are being fired from `orgjabrefmodelentrybibentry` to `orgjabrefmodeldatabasebibdatabase` which is relays them to other classes but not to `orgjabrefmodeldatabasebibdatabasecontext` which is where `orgjabrefmodeleventcoarsechangefilter` is listening `orgjabreflogicshareddbmssynchronizer` listens to `coarsechangefilter` || i discovered that when you type for example 7 characters into a field in a shared database `orgjabrefmodeleventcoarsechangefilter` considers the delta between the old field contents and the new field contents to be 7 for each letter typed because each typed character fires a `fieldchangedevent` and each one has a delta of 7 characters each one passes through the filter and causes a sync with the shared database perhaps this is because i type them faster than the gui can update the field? either way it should only fire one event with a delta of 7 characters or 7 events with a delta of one character (which would be stopped by the filter and prevented from causing a database sync) || the issue i mentioned above seems to be  however entries are still updated one at a time this appears to be because when you update multiple entries they are updated in a `for` loop each iteration fires an event which is listened to  dbmssynchronizer` `dbmssychronizer` makes one database query per event therefore if you delete 1000 entries 1000 events are fired this is one of the reasons bulk operations take so longat least some of the `for` loops are in `orgjabrefguibasepanel` which means they are also responsible for local database updates the only two ways i can think of to solve this problem are to change the `for` loops to account for firing fewer events to update remote databases or to aggregate events so that dbmssychronizer combines all the fired events into one query changing the `for` loops would mean changing code that is used by the rest of the app and i dont know if theres a clean way of aggregating events i can be more specific if that helpsdoes anyone have ideas on this? || @norwaymaple feel free to change the for loops to batch operations (such as `addall` or `removeall`) the code in basepanel is everything than sacred (in the contrary you are happily invited to refactor it as much as you want - its still one of the most dark and dangerous alleys in the jabref code world) i have no idea how updates to many entries (ie changing the value of a field) should be combined/aggregated these operations currently trigger an update of the ui and thus also lead to performance problems in a usual non-shared environment || @tobiasdiez i started writing the code to batch remove entries i ended up changing `entryremovedevent` to `entriesremovedevent` and changing the code wherever it was subscribed to that event it doesnt compile because i havent finished this is actually more of a refactoring of the entry events overall than specifically something that relates to database syncs also i still have to look into if the tests need to be changed i pushed it to a branch on my fork linked below would you be interested in me making a pr for this? || @norwaymaple  sounds good please  create  a pr  so we can look at the changes || sorry about any inconvenience caused herei am replicating the discussion that moved ahead in my repo (and will remove the repo to avoid further confusion) || @schniepp said:anyway my largest issue in connecting with the db is not longer the read/write performance but an issue where doing certain bulk operations would just create to a completely hanging jabref instance the only solution in these cases is to kill jabref and restart it i happens more often with a slow internet connection than with a fast one i usually see this when i am trying to move certain entries into a particular group (say 20 or so) in some cases it will do it for the first 4 or so and then get completely stuckbut unfortunately this is not reproducible sometimes it will not complete a single one and in other times all 20 will go through in a reasonably short time || @norwaymaple said:thanks for the feedback do you mean that the issue used to be read/write performance but now that is no longer a problem? or that the issue was never read/write performance? || @schniepp said:@norwaymaple: in the beginning it was indeed a performance issue the biggest performance issue got resolved indeed i believe i was the one who originally reported above that loading from a db with 3900 entries became as fast as loading the same entries from a *bib file this became possible after some of the fixes that were implemented in response to this reportonce this was fixed using the db remotely actually became a viable option for me i believe this is what enabled the discovery of the hanging/crashing issue perhaps this should be a separate report? but to some extent i was under the impression we are discussion various db related issues in this thread anyway || either way - we can use this thread or another one right now im making a fix to batch entry synchronization but i can look into the hanging operation later || this issue has been inactive for half a year since jabref is constantly evolving this issue may not be relevant any longer and it will be closed in two weeks if no further activity occursas part of an effort to ensure that the jabref team is focusing on important and valid issues we would like to ask if you could update the issue if it still persists this could be in the following form:- if there has been a longer discussion add a short summary of the most important points as a new comment (if not yet existing)- provide further steps or information on how to reproduce this issue- upvote the initial post if you like to see it implemented soon votes are not the only metric that we use to determine the requests that are implemented however they do factor into our decision-making process- if all information is provided and still up-to-date then just add a short comment that the issue is still relevantthank you for your contribution! || "";1;0;change wording;"

code for managing icons now all usages of `dejensdfxglyphs` or `dejensdfxglyphsmaterialdesignicons` are encapsulated in the package `guiicon`in there the usage of

running jabref-   ()-  (   ( [helpjabreforg](https://githubcom/jabref/helpjabreforg/issues)?);ok thank you for your suggestions i reworked it now and tried to improve it further by keeping all things related to materialdesignicons inside `guiicon` and outside of this package only `jabreficon`s are used that also made the class `jabrefmaterialdesigniconfactory` obsoleteit is working now as expected but there is one thing which should be improved: in the class `orgjabreflogicgroupsdefaultgroupsfactory` there was an import of `dejensdfxglyphsmaterialdesigniconsmaterialdesignicon` which passed the architecture tests when i refactored it i exchanged it with an import of `orgjabrefguiiconicontheme` which caused the architecture test to fail now im not sure how exactly the functionality in `defaultgroupsfactory` is needed and dont know how to properly do it to let the test pass i used a string constant nowi also added the architecture test you suggested and hope that it is correct as i havent done anything with archunit yet :) || > > > looks good but that workaround is no longer necessary?its not a workaround anymore but more a refactoring which also fixes the issuei would also say that it is ready to merge there is just the thing i described:> in the class `orgjabreflogicgroupsdefaultgroupsfactory` there was an import of `dejensdfxglyphsmaterialdesigniconsmaterialdesignicon`

what this pr adds?this pr is related to 343]( added a field formatter called **shorten doi** formatter which shortens doi using  service you run the formatter from _cleanup entries dialog_ by adding it to _run field formatter_ listit looks to work fine it enables one way conversion from doi to short doi### implementation details:i assumed that short doi is still a legal doi thats why i adjusted the doi class to work with short dois### feedback wantedi id like to ask for your feedback about the code at this stage### next step- add a more accessible ui - a toggle button next to the doi field _shortened/long version_ (this was suggested by @koppor)this will require adding opposite conversion (from short doi to doi) as  servcie doesnt offer such a feature i see two approaches:1 store the original doi during the conversion for further back conversion**drawback:** you may not convert from short doi to doi if you havent done the opposite conversion for at least one time2 try to obtain doi from short doi using  service as it is possible by catching the  redirectioni find the 1st approach fine the 2th approach is not really good as we are not using any public api and this can stop working in the futurewhat do you think folks? :)### importantif you would like to checkout this branch and test locally please use [shortdoi-workaround]( branch which uses workaround by @r0light for

the constructor of `linkedfileseditorviewmodel`:```bindingshelperbindcontentbidirectional(                                                files                                                text

#4871 (and #4964 ) does not seem to work because the binding is triggered directly from the call `entrysetfiles(files)` in `renamepdfcleanup` which is executed in a background thread and therefore leads to the exceptionalthough it is a bit strange because for other operations like `doicleanup` it is working fine and the method `uithreadlistsourcechanged` is called (i had a look at it to compare the behaviour):```""""pool-3-thread-3@7731"""" prio5 tid0x21 nidna runnable  javalangthreadstate: runnable	  at orgjabrefguiutiluithreadlistsourcechanged(uithreadlistjava:15)	  at

`bindingshelperbindcontentbidirectional`) to ensure all updates are executed on the javafx thread?   || see also #5010 || @r0light thanks for investigating this issue i agree that adding `runlater` would fix the problem however this also has some negative consequences because these observable lists are also used in non-ui situations (for example unit tests) for this reason i would prefer a wrapper around the original list that pushes the changes to the ui thread (and then binding this wrapper to the control)i had a quick look and found [griffon-javafx]( which includes such wrappers:  can simply use this library (or reimplement the small subset of the wrappers that we need at the moment starting from [their implementation]( @r0light are you willing to work on this? || @tobiasdiez

i noticed this behaviour before but as far as i remember you get the correct numbers of items contained in a group if you save your database then close jabref and then reopen the database in jabrefthis is still obviously a bug but a less serious one i guess - it is basically the updating process of the groups panel that does not work properly (which i think is also responsible for some other issues we see with the groups panel) || sometimes the number update if you switch to another db and then back again  || @siedlerchr however on switching to another library group count shows count of previous libraryi am looking into this issue right now what i have found is that when the database is changed a new instance of the `integerproperty hits` is created each time [[1]]( and `text` (representing gui for the number of hits) is being bound to this newly created instance [[2]]( therefore the binding does not prove useful herethe `text` should still be updated with the value of `hits` anyway but it turns out that the binding of `hits` to `text` is done before `hits` is updated it is because of another binding [[3]]( which internally triggers a callback to `viewmodeltreetablecellfactory`this results in `text` holding previous value of `hits` and not the current onewhen jabref starts up there are some initial calls made which have`hits` initialized to 0 and `text` binds to that until database is changed   || thanks for investigating this issue this is how it is supposed to work:- whenever a library gets the focus convert the group tree to a tree of `groupnodeviewmodel`s bind the value of the `hit` property to the text field whenever there are changes to the library update the hit count (which should then propagate to the text label through the above binding) it sounds reasonable that there is a problem with the binding of the text label to the correct hits property || @tobiasdiez i think the problem might actually be concerned with `databasecontextgetdatabase()getentries()addlistener(this::ondatabasechanged) `i added a print statement inside the function `ondatabasechanged` and it didnt print anything after a few entries were addedthe problem is related to this:  would solve issue 4679]( i think this issue might have more to do with the group being utilized in the line `texttextproperty()bind(groupgethits()asstring())` is the older group this causes value to not be set properly but i think this happens only if the only group you have is all entries || @tobiasdiez and @siedlerchr why do we have the all entries group available when no library has been opened in jabref?

|| @norwaymaple i think its referencing to the crossref functionality eg you have a child and parent relationship eg an entry inbook (child) is part of a book (parent) you can link these together || i think i have finished testing all the code i could test within reason feel free to review it however i would prefer that it not be merged yetmy plan is the following:1 create a branch `batch_remove_entry` on top of this branch `refactor_group_entryevents` where i will see if i can modify the sql in `dbmsprocessor` to delete multiple entries at once - the original reason for this change this way we can see if the refactoring ive done of `entriesevent`s was useful2 go back and do the same refactoring for `insertentry` making it insert entries in batches at this point we can merge this pr3 merge in `master` with the refactorings into the `batch_remove_entry` branch and create a new pr on that branch then change the sql to insert entries in batches and merge that pr as welli dont think batch entry updates are necessary because you dont change multiple entries at once so far as im aware let me know if i am wrong also let me know if anything else can be improved in either pr || true it might be easier to manage but it just feels too half-done at this point to merge also i got the sql to work in a couple hours - it was really easy so im already about to start step 2 of my plan see 125d33a28c28d081996004fa4b0736d28d873c41 || is everyone all set with the removing entries part of this pr? if so i will move into the insert part and then after that we can merge the pr || for batching the insert entries functionality (which ive started on a local branch) i am looking through all the calls of `insertentry` to see if they can be converted to `insertentries` for example in `orgjabrefguiimporterappenddatabaseaction` line 77 `databaseinsertentry(entry)` can be moved outside the `for` loop and be put after line 81 as `databaseinsertentries(appendedentries)` is there any reason not to make those kinds of changes?

at least that is how mendeley is doing this personally i liked it the way jabref had implemented things before i am not so sure whether people are happy with the current solution i e entry preview + open editor (but with multiple entry tabs)> 3 not so sure about the space currently using a 1920x1080 screen with jabref using up half of the screen there it is definitely too small at work i have a 4k screen where jabref is using up a quarter of the screen ( +- jabref in full screen on a 1920x1080 screen) i dont think jabref is supposed to be used in full screen mode i dont think many people have larger screens (especially when you include laptop users)> _originally posted by @aegit in https://githubcom/jabref/jabref/pull/4976#issuecomment-524629484_;> i would very much like a simple and one-click way to disable showing the citation preview i spent quite some time looking for it when i got the update since i could not believe that this change was introduced without an option to switch off the preview that takes away space and cpu cycles for keeping it updated_originally posted by @johann-petrak in  || to add to this issue i copy over also the other message i had written there> i know this is a big thing to ask but can you please revert this change and/or make it just optional i have just had a look at jabref 50-alpha--snapshot--2019-08-25--master--0c342bdc7 to test #4808 (comment) just to realise that the entry preview is no longer automatically shown at all> > i am heavily reliant on using the entry preview i often tend to quickly go through different entries and the entry preview gives me a quick overview of the entry now i always have to open the entry editor just to see the preview my feeling is that this change was introduced by people who actually do not even use the entry preview at all (see also comment here: #4976 (comment)) this new behaviour is completely different from the old jabref behaviour and from similar reference managers (eg mendeley)> so unless you can suggest a change in the way i should use jabref now (maybe i just dont understand how the entry preview is now supposed to be used) while keeping my user scenario - i e quickly cycle through entries and always get a quick summary of the respective entry - i would ask to drop this change or make it optional_originally posted by @aegit in  || jabref 50-alpha--snapshot--2019-08-25--master--0c342bdc7windows 10 100 amd64 java 180_221ok so i have played around a little bit with the new entry preview and i can now definitely say that i would like to see the old behaviour re-instated or alternatively to make the new behaviour optionalfirst of all it is no longer possible to quickly cycle through different entries and get a quick idea what they are about they always have to be opened to see the entry preview (i have already mentioned this in previous posts)second there was the suggestion to keep the entry editor always open so that it would be possible again to cycle through all the entries while seeing the entry preview (see  i am now confident that this is not a good solution for the problem since there is not enough space for both the entry editor and the entry preview when the group panel is opened as well i provide a picture to give you an idea of the problem![untitled]( that jabref here is using half (!) of the screen on a 24 monitor with a resolution of 1920x1080 this definitely does not do a good job at the moment i suggest to revert the changes of  or to come up with a better solutionedit: my impression is that many of the current ui changes especially those focused on the entry preview have been made without having the group panel open if i close the group panel (which i would never do for my actual work since the groups are essential) there seem to be fewer issues with the ui i e often i now have enough space but when the groups panel is open most of the time the ui looks wierd and horizontal space is missing (also because new elements use up more space than they would need to) for further changes to the ui i would therefore recommend to always have the groups panel open as well || entry preview does not adapt to dark mode:( || i dont know whether this has been mentioned already but the two screenshots posted in this thread emphasise another issue with the current entry editor it does not do an automatic return which leads to entry content disappearing in the ui if the content is too long for the entry row (see for example the author field in the post above:  this is especially a problem with the newly introduced entry preview that is now part of the entry editor || ah you mean wrapping text || hmm yes -

500-dev--2019-10-17----e81d58c51windows 10 100 amd64 java 1202the entry preview does not adapt to dark mode this issue has already been reported by @siedlerchr here (including an image) //githubcom/jabref/jabref/issues/5244#issuecomment-528028140;hello im pretty new to github but would like to work on this issue is it okay? || @taerim25  sure go ahead ! i think it should work if you adapt the  background color of the entry preview control in the dark theme css fileplease have a look at our contributing guide for gettings things done || update: preview content itself was updated in form of html injected in `previewview  new webview()` (located in previewviewerjava) i was able to change the color of webview object itself but it wouldnt show on the app as the injected html is placed on top of it i can modify the css of the injected html by manually making a new css file and embedding it on to the html but that wouldnt make it compatible with existing css files (darkcss and basecss)anybody has any idea on how to approach this? || @tobiasdiez do we have a variable for checking if dark mode is enabled?  || yes sadly it is not possible to style the content of the webview using the central javafx css the easiest solution is probably to embed the correct style directly as done here: || @taerim25 actually there is a preferences key which stores which theme the user has selected so you could use this for checking and adapting the css || thanks to the good work of @taerim25 this should be  in the latest development version could you please check the build from

user would expect that this happen and should we only show a notification in error case?- is `closed library` in `jabrefframe` obsolete? is directly represented in the view- is `new library created` in `fromauxdialog` obsolete?- in all actions should the `going to do something` message be replaced with a progress bar and one final notification? actions might take long and any thoughts about hindering the user from messing with the db during operation?    - saveallaction    - exportcommand    - cleanupaction    - generatingbibtexkeyaction    - duplicatesearch- `this action requires one or more entries to be selected` notification looks the same as a successful notification should the action be disabled in the menu bar?    - additionally when using `cmd + c` no such popup is presented- is `saving library` obsolete? maybe short spinner- in attachfileaction `this operation requires exactly one entry to be selected` can the action be disabled?- are the messages in `toggleunionintersection` obsolete? it is directly represented in the view- is `added group` obsolete?- is `modified group` obsolete?- is `removed group` obsolete?- is `files opened` obsolete?- is `file already open` obsolete? could we just switch to the tab of the opened file?- can `opening file` be replaced with a progress bar or spinner?- is `opened database` obsolete? directly visible in ui- is the `connection lost` notification obsolete as there is a popup with the same text right afterwards anyway? || thanks for the throughout analysis the notifications should be shown only if there is no visible change (or the change might be so minimal that users dont notice them) thus i agree with the items you listed except for the following:- `preferences recorded`  although expected there is no visible feedback and it doesnt hurt to notify the user about a successful action- notifications related to the groups as these changes might be small and easily missed if you have large group treesi also like the idea to replace the progress notifications by some spinner and/or progress bar not sure however how easily this can be  > i also like the idea to replace the progress notifications by some spinner and/or progress bar not sure however how easily this can be implementeddo you know [darktable]( i think they have a nice system implemented: they use stackable progressbars and system notificationsso if you do some things after each other the progressbars will stack up if one item is finished you get a notification into the system bus (depending on your os and bus system you use) || i think eclipse also has this multiple progress bars window for tasks to be performed  || okay i think there are multiple tasks here:- remove obsolete notifications (this issue)- implement spinner/progress notification for longer tasks- disable actions that are not possible (#4795 and koppor#156) - do not show notification for automated saving task (this issue)to keep this issue as small as possible i would suggest we just remove the obsolete notifications and disabling notifications for automated saving for this issue add another ui improvement issue for the spinner and another for disabling not possible actions what do you think @tobiasdiez ? || @ka0o0 thank you for the precise task list maybe you can add  to your list? ðŸ˜‡  the third issue (""""disable actions that are not possible"""") is  and somehow refs  || ive added the later two ones but i dont quite understand how koppor#96 fits into this issue? || thanks to @ka0o0  this isssue should be partially resolved nowthere should be no longer save messages on autosvave ||  related to """"disable actions that are not possible"""" in case no database is opened more actions are not possible i think one has to check if a database is opened in this context one could also think about a background picture (at least it is closer to this issue than probably most other issues here ^^) || thanks for all the fixes it already looks much better!i think you can also remove the """"looking for full text online"""" status message as there is a window tooon another but maybe similar issue regarding status messages:i had to use jabref 4 recently and i noticed that there is even a dialog which shows the current progress of downloading which seems to be removed in 5x? or do i have to somehow enable this? || thank you for reporting this issue we think that is already  in our development version and consequently the change will be included in the next releasewe would like to ask you to use a development build from  and report back if it works for you please remember to make a backup of your library before trying-out this version || "";1;0;remove unused imports;"

(?) (?) (?)` for four entries but i could use batches of single row `insert` statements instead if that it at least just as efficient recommendations?@tobiasdiez i think you are right because multiple users might then have different shared ids for the same `bibentry` so if one person updates an entry the wrong one will be synchronized also they have to be connected via foreign key to the `field` table so my algorithm wont work || if you write a test now it should fail then you can experiment with the different options until the test pass i would suggest that the test generates a bunch of random entries (say 100) and then inserts them afterwards you can check that the shared id is the correct one for all entries || okay so far ive been hard-coding the example entries for the tests i could do say 5 or even 100 but are you thinking i might use some other means to generate the random entries? also are we satisfied making sure the tests pass given it is technically possible for the jdbc implementations to change at any time and there is no guarantee that they will maintain orderedness? || i guess a for loop from i  1 to 100 which generates entries ala `new bibentry()withkey(i)withfield(journal """"journal"""" + i)` should be sufficient dont have to be complex entriesi would be satisfied if this tests passes if in the future the implementation changes then we get notified by the test which then fails || i am very confused about a bug that appears to be in `oracleprocessor` in the method i just wrote `insertintoentrytable` when i run the database tests with oracle i always get `javasqlsqlsyntaxerrorexception: ora-00933: sql command not properly ended` if i just execute the sql as an ordinary statement rather than a prepared statement and hard-code a parameter the query executes so it must be a problem with the prepared statement for now these are lines 121-127 ideas? || @norwaymaple is it something about a `` required in some settings and sometimes not? i had this when playing aroundwe are planning to release the 50 version this weekend do you think you can finish this pr by friday? if not i will drop oracle support causes too much trouble i think we should go for  wdyt? || if you look at the oracle jdbc source code the reason oracle says the sql is not properly ended is because the jdbc secretly inserts a `returning` `into` clause to get the generated key problem is that `insert all` statements require a `select` statement at the end for arbitrary reasons so the `returning` clause after `select` confuses the database there may be a way using `bulk collect` to do it but there are no examples online and the documentation is surprisingly poor if you say oracle is out-of-style then by all means drop the support i have no opinion on mysqlfinally as a note on oracle i should be able to make oracle work iteratively with a sql statement for each entry (but not one per field) this would mean it wasnt optimized like postgres and mysql but this would be an easy and fast fix on my end and we wouldnt even have to completely drop oracleim not sure about friday i may have full-time work starting tomorrow on a temp job starting tomorrow and an interview on wednesday i can try and do saturday afternoon but im in the us east time zone so that might be saturday evening and night for you and i still have to prepare for my interview however if you ignore oracle i think i can complete the pr much faster even without wwwjooqorg so there may not be a lot of work left || i did the main fixes i wanted to do so they work on postgres and mysql now i just have to test the oracle manually test it in the gui fix `checkstyle` and take a final look at the pr diff || @koppor ive done the manual testing and `checkstyle` and looked at the pr diff the only thing left to do is test it in oracle the code is simple and it is a hassle for me to work with docker i think if we merge it in it might be easiest for githubs ci to tell us if it passes the oracle tests i know oracles not important but we are so close! but for that you have to merge it into the upstream because i cant do it from my fork || looks like we are now getting `error processing tar file(exit status 1): write /opt/oracle/product/18c/dbhomexe/md/property_graph/lib/lucene-analyzers-common-4104jar: no space left on device` in the run see  so we still dont know if oracle works it might be worth figuring out || "";;;;1;1;revert port setting;"

open file """"/path/to/my/pdf/mypdf""""?this dialogue will close automatically after 5 minutes of inactivity```my pdfs are stored on a ntfs formatted drive (i am running linux and windows in a dual-boot configuration) which is mounted to /media/myuser to access that folder using the snap version of jabref it was necessary to use the removable-media option i e `sudo snap connect jabref:removable-media` this allows jabref to access the drive/folder however the message reported above will still appear every time jabref tries to open an associated file stored on the ntfs formatted drive is there a way so that i only have to accept this message once? is this even a jabref issue or is this something related to the general implementation of snap?see also: || with the most recent dev snapshot (jabref 50-dev--snapshot--2019-09-05--master--99a0a7a8d) pdf files open instantaneously have there been any recent changes on that code?i think we may close the ticket || this behaviour is still present in the with the deb package in  in 2019-10-21 || the same version from sources works for me || and by sources you mean exactly the same link i provide above?i just tested again on a fresh installation of kubuntu 1910 the behaviour is exactly the one that j0hannes described in the first comment i can also reproduce what aegit described with the snap package even though my files are stored in the same unit as jabref || these are the sources:  make a difference to what you find in the deb package though || i should have said in my previous comment the same behaviour with the sources you mentioned  || update: seems to be a permissions problem the path for the application in my system is `/opt/jabref/bin/jabref` however if i run `sudo /opt/jabref/bin/jabref` it is possible to open pdf files as usual this might offer some workarounds || to my surprise i couldnt open pdf files on my other machine which is set up identically to the one where it worked after upgrading ther error message was `kf5kiowidgets: malformed url: """"""""`after changing the standard library path for pdfs from a symlink to the real path opening those pdfs worked again it seems as if symlinks are problematic for jabref or one of its components running it as root might circumvent the problem that symlinks are causing - just a wild guess || thanks for the hint with symlinks  there might be an option which needs to be passed to the path methods and also the hint for snaps || @j0hannes i think they are different (although possibly related) errors the one that you mention seems to be a path issue a very similar error occurs if your links (the links that jabref uses to the files) are broken in particular when the file path is not well configured the links in my situation are well configured since i can open pdf files without changing them anyways thanks for the input  || i ran into (seemingly) the same issue on kde neon if i try to open a pdf i only see the okular icon jumping around my cursor but then it vanishes without okular startingi also found out that if i have okular open already i can open pdfs without problem (they appear in new tabs in the same okular instance as this is the way i have okular configured)info from jabrefs about-page:```jabref 500-dev--2019-10-25----681d6aa6flinux 500-32-generic amd64 java 1202``` || i have the same problem i downloaded the latest snapshopt of jabref and i cannot get to open any pdf i tried with okular open as described by krzmbrzl but the pdf not opening for mei tried to run jabref with sudo now when i click on the pdf icon the pdf file opens but with gimpany ideas on how to resolve the problem? || hmm as far as i remember jabref simply uses xdg-open or passes the file path to xdg open || @t-morales did you try using xdg-open to open the pdf from the command-line? || i tried with xdg-open:- running with normal user it opens pdf correctly- running as sudo or root i have seen that it was not correctly configured to okular so i have set now okular as default for root- now when i run jabref with sudo pdf opens correctly with okular- when i run jabref as normal user still the same behavior the pdf does not open || hi:anyone has any more information on this topic?up to now the only workaround i found is to run jabref with sudo || jabrefs code is to call xdg open or a configured application  you please specify if it makes any difference from where you open the pdf?eg from the maintable or from the general tab || it makes no difference using the main table or the general tab does not open pdf filei do not obtain any error message or information on what the problem is the only thing that works for me is to run jabref with sudo command then clicking on the pdf icon will

viewer is set as default  || very interesting id like to stress though that when running `xdg-open` on my machine from the command line it opens just fine in okular so it seems to not be a problem

with the snap as well || does jabref somehow interact with the system via its own pseudo user? if thatd be the case then maybe the problem is that `xdg-open` doesnt work with that specific user account  || please be aware that the java runtimeexec() is not a shell! its much more limited:  i guess this is some okular specific issue? i could only add some code to display results from error or output stream in jabref maybe this gets some insights || did someone try to write a small standalone java application that uses `exec` and `xdg-open`to open a pdf via okular?  || in ubuntu-mate i tried running a java repl (jshell) with the following command:`runtimegetruntime()exec(""""xdg-open <path-to-pdf>"""")`and it succesfully opened  okular (the default pdf viewer in my system settings) || i am not a java expert but it seems that this is java related i have tried the following program in java:```import javaiobufferedreaderimport javaioinputstreamreaderpublic class testprog {    public static void main(string args) {        string s        process p        try {            p  runtimegetruntime()exec(""""xdg-open <path-to-pdf>"""")        } catch (exception e) {}    }}```when the default application is set as okular the pdf does not openwhen i switch to atril it works || if anyone knows where or how i could get more information on this topic i would be grateful || you can try to see if there is an error message using```java    bufferedreader in  new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(pgeterrorstream()))    string line    while ((line  inreadline()) ! null) {        systemoutprintln(line)    }    pwaitfor()    systemoutprintln(""""ok!"""")    inclose()``` second part of the answer (using processbuilder) also might be worth a try || @t-morales that simple program works on my system so i dont think its a java issue || so i think that i am close to know what is happening for some reason there is an error message that is obtained: `discarding """"send sms via kde connect"""" (""""shareurl"""")`but now using the extra commands given by @tobiasdiez the pdf opens with okularwhat i mean is that the code```import javaiobufferedreaderimport javaioinputstreamreaderpublic class testprog {    public static void main(string args) {        string s        process p        try {            p  runtimegetruntime()exec(""""xdg-open

systemoutprintln(line)            }	    pwaitfor()	    systemoutprintln(""""ok!"""")    inclose()        } catch (exception e) {}    }}```will open the pdfmy guess is that in the previous code an error occurs which is not handled and then okular is closed while this code is treating correctly the error or warning messages if that makes sense || would be kinda weird but i guess it wouldnt be unheard of xdyou mentioning kde brings to my mind that maybe this is a kde specific bug as i am using kde as well did someone encounter this bug with a different desktop environment?  || thank you so much for your help i now have a modified version of jabref that works!what i did is to edit the file src/main/java/org/jabref/gui/desktop/os/linuxjava and replace`runtimegetruntime()exec(cmdarray)`by```process pp  runtimegetruntime()exec(cmdarray)bufferedreader in  new bufferedreader(new inputstreamreader(pgeterrorstream()))string lineline  inreadline()```probably not a pretty solution but as i said i am not familiarized with java now the pdf files open correctly with okular || @t-morales  glad that it works it would be really helpful for all others if you could open a pull request with your changes see [contributing]( for some details eg just create a fork and a branch || ok i hope i did it correctly: 5855]( it would be great if someone with better understanding took a look at the proposed solution it was more or less a trial and error solution  || thanks to @t-morales this should be  in the latest development version could

without waiting for okularits a little bit weird that this java program works with envince but it does not work in jabref as i said running `xdg-open` in the terminal works with both viewers || for me it worked with okular with that program maybe try to fix all those warnings? it seems that it cannot find the icons and themes so i would try to install them to see if that changes anything || huh so switching my system icon theme to a standard theme (like breeze) fixes all problems because then all these warnings/errors disappear it also works in jabref thenim using the candy icons theme from the kde store these warnings are caused by many custom icon packs eg see  installing the missing icon themes does not really help because installing one theme adds new errors and i got stuck with """"icon theme """"gnome-colors-wise"""" not found"""" which i couldnt find anywhere to install i continued by modifying the `indextheme` file of the icon pack and removed the dependencies on the other themes so im just left with the `invalid context` warnings but then it still does not work it seems like okular wont start from java when anyhting appears in `stderr` so this has to be a bug somewhere although im not sure in which component in this chain specifically || so i removed some further dependencies/inheritances from the `indextheme` file of the icon theme and now all warnings are gone and it works from java/jabref again but i still dont get why this prevents okular from opening i dont know if its a bug with okular `xdg-open` or some weirdness of javas `exec`edit: i replaced `xdg-open` with a direct call to `okular` and this works again even with the warnings appearing in the terminal so it really is related to this cursed combination of `okular` `xdg-open` and java || so i found a workaround in java instead of using `exec` with `xdg-open` directly it is possible to use `desktopgetdesktop()open()` to open any file with the standard application:```javaimport javaawtdesktopimport javaiofilepublic class testprog {    public static void main(string args) {        try {            desktopgetdesktop()open(new file(""""<path to pdf>""""))        } catch (exception e) {}    }}```but im not sure if using this might not be possible in jabref due to java version restrictions || "";1;0;fix checkstyle;"

subsequently this pr fixes this issueit has been tested for local files and web urls-  change in changelogmd described (if applicable)-  -  [](   <https://githubcom/jabref/user-documentation/issues>"";""thank you very much for your contribution!fix looks good!  || is there still something i need to do or is everything fine because one check failed? || you can ignore the failing check its just the upload of the binaries which sometimes failsour code quality policy requires a review from a second reviewer for external developers before it can be mergedi think you also should add a changelog entry since its at least an error from the beta/previous version || would a proper implementation of rfc 3986 be an overkill? maybe this could be achieved with a proper regex? this || @calixtus checking a path as follows could be a simple alternative  but nevertheless i also see advantages with the current approach since it also detects urls as web urls even if they are potentially broken in some way this was the reason why i created it like that i think the main goal is to identify a web url rather than checking its validity || @systemoperator  that should work using new url() in practice and i think should be sufficient for most cases as an indicator || i eg think about the following scenario: given are broken web urls like:-  googleat/ <- mind the unintended space character-  <- mind the unintended second period- i think in this screnario it is more important to identify whether it is a web url or not rather than making it more strict saying checking whether it is a valid web url because in the case that it would be a invalid web url (as eg shown above) then in this scenario the url would again get cleaned up and thus it will become even more """"destoryed"""" as it would be interpreted as a local file url again and many other issues would again show upon the other hand if a broken url gets identified as a web url then it will be processed properly and everything will work out but when opening the url it just cannot be loadedin my opinion this method is all about identifying a web url not validating one (thats why it is called isonlinelink() rather than isvalidonlinelink()) || somewhere i think youre some kind of right too on the other hand where do we want to decide whats still a acceptable and what not? what about """"file://"""" (im aware that normally a file path is printed without this here but it still could happen) we also had a few months ago someone here using jabref as database for genetics stuff and not for books (proofing the mutability of jabref)please dont misunderstand me i get your point and i dont exactly know the right answer || before implementing it i thought about many of those things with the current implementation a file link starting with """"file://"""" will not be interpreted as a web url anyway so this would be fine as well || at least the javadoc should then be adapted -) || of course i would like to hear @tobiasdiezs recommendation about that as well then i will implement it as desired :) || i think the current implementation is a good compromise in the ideal world the url is valid and a proper validation as @calixtus would be preferable however the data quality we get from some fetchers is suboptimal so that it is a good idea to error on the save side (eg better identify to many paths as web urls) i suggest to merge now and come back to it later if users complain / provide problematic use cases || "";making paths of linked files relative

|| remark: i guess this problem will affect various entry types so that some fields might not be shown at all (meaning: specific fields like `editor` are sometimes shown nowhere so neither in the tab """"required fields"""" nor in the tab """"optional fields"""" etc) i would prefer that all required """"orfields"""" show up in the tab """"required fields"""" (maybe it could be indicated somehow that either the one or the other is finally required) || i have noticed that -- even if i changed something in `biblatexentrytypedefinitionsjava` like converting `new orfields(standardfieldauthor standardfieldeditor)` to `standardfieldauthor standardfieldeditor` for testing purposes -- the gui did not reflect these changes due to the fact that in `jabrefmainjava` some custom or modified types get loaded:        globalsentrytypesmanageraddcustomormodifiedtypes(preferencesloadbibentrytypes(bibdatabasemodebibtex)                preferencesloadbibentrytypes(bibdatabasemodebiblatex))i found out that these files are stored in:`~/java/userprefs/org/jabref/customizedbiblatextypes/prefsxml`and`~/java/userprefs/org/jabref/customizedbibtextypes/prefsxml`my questions:- how were they created?- is it possible to simply disable these custom or modifed types? || i would recommend for now that in `requiredfieldstabjava` the method `determinefieldstoshow(bibentry entry)` resolves eg `orfields(standardfieldauthor standardfieldeditor)` to `standardfieldauthor standardfieldeditor` by updating `fieldsaddall(entrytypeget()getrequiredfields()stream()map(orfields::getprimary)collect(collectorstoset()))` correspondinglyhow can this be achieved? || the custom and builtin entry types can be modified using the dialog manage custom entry types see my other pr where i reimplemented that dialog  || oh i see in the master branch this entry in the options is currently hidden || @siedlerchr do you know how my suggestion (see above) could be implemented? || not completely sure but the following might work: Ì€`fieldsaddall(entrytypeget()getrequiredfields())` the problem is the `getprimary` call which only gets the first of the `orfield` || "";1;0;fix checkstyle;"

build:java 1302on ubuntu 1604the value of the entry type field for an entry in the main table is not updating when changing its type by using the dropdown menu of the entry editor to differentiate this from issue #5905 one can assume that in the entry editor the tab """"biblatex source"""" is not/never active**steps to reproduce the behavior:**1 double click an entry in the main table (with eg entry type """"article"""")2 change entry type via the dropdown menu to a different entry type (eg entry type """"misc"""")3 do """"whatever you want"""" but dont open the tab """"biblatex source"""" in the entry editor_observation:_ commonly the entry type will not change in the main table even if shortly selecting a different entry in the main table and reselecting the edited one sometimes temporarily switching to a different opened library helps but not alwayscontrarily other fields in the main table will be updated immediately when their values get changed---**subsequent observation (now allows viewing the tab """"biblatex source""""):**1 perform steps 1 and 2 as above2 save library with ctrl+s3 switch to """"biblatex source""""_observation:_ the library has been modifed (indicated with the star symbol """"*"""") although no change was condutedfor both cases i assume it could be some reference problem"";""its only a display issue: if you change the entry type save and reload the database the change is correctly reflected || @tobiasdiez on the one hand i wanted to address the display issues (in the main table and in the tab """"biblatex source"""" where in the source the entry type sometimes does not get updated) on the other hand i think it is not only a display issue:**consider the following:**_prerequisite:_ make sure that in options -> preferences -> entry editor -> """"show bibtex source by default"""" is not ticked1 double click or click an entry in the main table (with eg entry type """"article"""") to see its entry editor2 change entry type via the dropdown menu to a different entry type (eg entry type """"misc"""")3 save library with ctrl+s4 switch to """"biblatex source""""    _observation:_ the library shows that it has been modifed (indicated with the star symbol """"*"""") although no change was conducted after saving it furthermore to be precise the tab """"biblatex source"""" still shows the original entry type (so not the new one!) in the source text _if this is not all the case switch to a tab different than """"biblatex source"""" (eg tab """"required fields"""") and again start from step 2 (using now another different entry type so that you can better differentiate them) [usually the first """"round"""" is ok but any further round not this obviously depends on what one has already done before performing this procedure]_5 optional: switch to a different tab than """"biblatex source""""6 again save library with ctrl+s (-> the modified indicator (*) vanishes)7 reload library (by closing and reopening it)_observation:_ the performed change (namely changing the entry type) has been overwritten to the previous entry typethis could indicate a reference issue as well from my perspective it seems that the tab """"biblatex source"""" still references to the previous entry (or the changes simply have not been written to the tab """"biblatex source"""") and it """"writes back"""" the contained values since it is (and must be) quite sensitive to changes || @calixtus you recently  a bug and reused that code editor component maybe this is the issue now for the incorrect reference?that would explain why we did not reuse the control but recreated every time  || im going to investigate this tomorrow || i took a look into the code its two bugs: one thing is about the source tab it easily fixed by adding an invalidationlistener to the typeproperty (fix incoming for issue #5905 )the other one this here is about displaying the changed entry type in the main table || this bug here could be a simply consequence of the fact that  not contain `type` thus changes of the type do not trigger change events (and thus the main table is not updated) || i tried the simple fix idea from @tobiasdiez and added entrytype to the observables however this has only an impact on the previewviewer the observables are only used in the previeviewerhowever i think we need to have a simliar class like fieldcoumn which handles the entry type or maybe we can extend the fieldcolumn i could not find anything related to the entry type in the maintable so i guess this explains it because entry type is not a field its not updated || i think i found the problem:types are displayed as a normal field column however  includes real fields as dependencies  display still works as its done via this includes special handling of types it should be possible to fix this issue by adding a special handling of the type field in || thanks for the hint adding a check for the entry type in that binding works || i can confirm that all problems mentioned within this issue are fixed with this commit :) one very related issue (where i hoped this would fix it as well) is still open: #5905 || "";1;0;use easybind

open a pdf a new window """"open with"""" opens which asks me which application should be used to open the pdf given that the default pdf reader should be set in ubuntu (if i doubleclick a pdf in the file manager it will automatically open without asking me which application to use) this appears to be an undesired behaviour could it be linked to some sort of interaction between snap and then gnome filemanager?2) <kbd>f4</kbd> does not work for me i e no file is being opened if i press <kbd>f4</kbd> a leftclick however allows me to open a pdf (well if first shows the windows mentioned in 1) and after i select the application it opens the pdf) || "";1;0;use process builder and close reader;"

with gradle latest master from server seems to worksome resource files cannot be located || i can reproduce the same issue when running via gradle it also happens when trying to access the """"general"""" tab of an entry with a linked filei tried to investigate it and it seems that inside the class `dejensdfxglyphsglyphsfactory` the line `fontloadfont(glyphsfactoryclassgetresource(pathtoiconfont)openstream() 100)` throws the npe because it cannot find the resource `/de/jensd/fx/glyphs/materialdesignicons/materialdesignicons-webfontttf` therefore it probably occurs everytime when materialdesignicons are usedbut it only happens for the `gradle run` task and not for the built `jar` therefore it seems to be an issue with resources being available during the `gradle run`  || i guess the reason is the following change in behavior of `getresource` in java 9+:> if this class is in a named module then this method will attempt to find the resource in the module this is done by delegating to the modules class loader findresource(stringstring) method invoking it with the module name and the absolute name of the resource resources in named modules are subject to the rules for encapsulation specified in the module getresourceasstream method and so this method returns null when the resource is a non-""""class"""" resource in a package that is not open to the callers module >  a resource in a named module may be encapsulated so that it cannot be located by code in other modules whether a resource can be located or not is determined as follows:    if the resource name ends with """"class"""" then it is not encapsulated    a package name is derived from the resource name if the package name is a package in the module then the resource can only be located by the caller of this method when the package is open to at least the callers module if the resource is not in a package in the module then the resource is not encapsulatedmaybe somebody else finds the time to investigate this further and look for a fix || so the problem here is that `dejensdfxglyphsglyphsfactory` is in the module `dejensdfxfontawesomefxcommons` but wants to access the resource `/de/jensd/fx/glyphs/materialdesignicons/materialdesignicons-webfontttf` in the module `dejensdfxfontawesomefxmaterialdesignicons`i guess the proper way to address this would be to open an issue at [ in the meantime it would be possible to use a workaround and not use the `materialdesigniconfactory` (which internally uses `glyphsfactory`) so for example in `orgjabrefguifieldeditorslinkedfileseditor` this would be working:```java// current code not workingbutton acceptautolinkedfile  materialdesigniconfactoryget()createiconbutton(materialdesigniconbriefcase_check)// workaroundbutton acceptautolinkedfile  new button()glyphicon<materialdesignicon> linkedfileicon  new materialdesigniconview(materialdesigniconbriefcase_check)acceptautolinkedfilesetgraphic(linkedfileicon)```although im not sure whether this works at all places where those icons are usedwhat do you think?i could try to implement the workaround || @r0light  if this works it would be best to create  a """"wrapper"""" in jabref maybe a """"jabrefmaterialdesignfactory"""" which has the same methods as the original but withouth the glyph factory so we could later easily replace it again when its  || ok and what would be a good place for this wrapper?maybe `orgjabrefguiicon`?  || yes guiicon is good there are also these other icon-related classes  || thanks for investigating this the wrapper sounds like a good idea indeed moreover every used icon should be put in this list  would be nice if you could fix this along the way (and maybe even add an architectur test for it)  || ok so i opened an issue here: [ and i opened a pull request which should solve the problem: it covers all places where `materialdesigniconfactory` was used and simply replaced it with `jabrefmaterialdesigniconfactory` as a temporary workaroundi also added all icons used that i found to the list in icontheme@tobiasdiez considering the architecture test: what exactly do you have in mind there what should be tested? || thanks to @r0light  this should be fixed now || "";1;0;icons from material

|| @calixtus i hoped to get some ideas about solving this issue ok if there are no any ideas i will continue to investigate myself we have to disable main menu from listening """"ctrl+v"""" and keep it listening in `maintablejava`ill be back with ideas || does ctrl + c or ctrl + x also call an edit action? maybe there is some design flaw in a hotkey that is defined twice by setupkeybindings and the the menu command || ctrl+x works in the same way1) when i press """"command + x"""" the program deletes 2 (two) entries from current lib2) then i move the cursor to another lib and press """"command + v""""3) jabref inserts last entry to the new library ie one entry just disappearsit looks like jabref cut entries twicechecked from intellij and using last stable version from jabreforg  || why do we need `setupkeybindings` method in `maintablejava`? when i delete copy/paste/cut commands from it the program works finethis lines:```                    case paste:                        paste()                        eventconsume()                        break                    case copy:                        copy()                        eventconsume()                        break                    case cut:                        cut()                        eventconsume()```so why do we need those commands in `maintablejava`? || the reason is that you can define custom keybindings (options? manage keybindings) for all commands and so people can use their emacs/vim whatever paste command stylefor mac we use the keybindings and simply replace ctrl with meta in the keybindingrepositorymaybe that is part of the problem as well?```   public keycombination getkeycombination(keybinding bindname) {        string binding  get(bindnamegetconstant())        if (osos_x) {            binding  bindingreplace(""""ctrl"""" """"meta"""")        }        return keycombinationvalueof(binding)    }``` || @siedlerchr if i remove this line of code  `binding  bindingreplace(""""ctrl"""" """"meta"""")` i just have to use """"command"""" button on mac instead of """"control"""" a bit more natural for iosthe problem persistswhat about main menu? i mean if you wanna change key combinations and we remove that lines from `maintablejava` does main menu works with new key combinations for copy/pase/cut?  || i will test this on windows : options -> customize keybindings:( changed copy/paste to the following (alt gr+o and alt gr+p) i can copy and paste using those shortcuts ctrl+c and ctrl+v then dont worki also tested uncommenting the `setupkeybindings `in maintableno difference no duplicatesso now we would need someone on linux who can test this || linux user wanted! :-) || @lyzardking  could you assist in testing this on linux?

briefly generated and then vanishing only occasionally when i hit save the error occurs || okay thanks that no such file exception is probably a timing problem and  might be related how unix handles files || helloi have an analogous problem with jabref 51 under windows 10i also had the proboem with jabref 50 (i intalled jabref 51 as with a large repositories jabref 50 is very slow and i could not use it a problem fixed in jabref 51)in particular the problem manifests when i type in a field eg i tried in """"abstract"""" or """"comment"""" (the latter a custom field)it also manifests with a brand new jabref repository having just 1 entryactually the problem is two-fold:1) sometimes i get the exception reported below (i report the log for both the exception when typing the abstract field and when typing the comment field)2) sometimes the cursor jumps at the beginning of the field i released this happens each time i save so a first bug is that the cursor jumps at the beginning of the field when saving eg with the automatic saving which is very annoying i read above that the problem of the discussion thread might be related to saving which would explain why the two errors seemed to me to be linkedthe two problems are so impairing that basically i cannot write text longer than few words in jabref fields so i have to write it in another editor and then

on?*`bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey` gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets (eg `""""{the school of life}""""`) the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key (eg null if there is no name)*why is it going on?*academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg `""""royal institute of technology: the school of electrical engineering and computer science""""` which `generateinstitutionkey` shortens to `riteecs`*fix*replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg `the school of life` -> `l`)*what are alternatives?*1 regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of `the school of life` would be abbreviated to `sl` instead of `l`**2 fix to the author column**when the list of authors gets converted to a latex-free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex-free string is used to create/fetch an `authorlist` it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone**3 what i think is left to do**-  find out why `{the school of life}`  isnt respected in the author field of the gui-  ~~attempt to match universities etc with regex~~ assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities-  ~~update `bibtexkeygeneratortest` as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods~~ the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file-  see if the readability of `generateinstitutionkey` can be improved-  ~~change the key generator for institution/corporate names to a formatter?~~ `generateinstitutionkey` should not be a separate formatter it is only called  normalize`and<!-- - go through the list below if a task has been completed

that the latex2unicode convert is called for the author field it kills the extra braces i had a similar problem in the msoffice exporter  i think i implemented a workaround there || ah nice thank you! i will take a look! || i believe this is fixable in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` by splitting it into bibtex/latex according to whichever bibtex version are supported but the problems are1 i cant find which bibtex version we are supporting in [adr]( nor anywhere else2 `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` appears to be used both for bibtex in utf-8 (eg `""""{lÃ¢tÃ«x}""""`) and for fully """"expanded"""" text (eg `""""lÃ¢tÃ«x""""`) as those are incompatible perhaps it makes sense to split the method and track down what method wants what?3 should i do this?4 i can attempt to do the same workaround but it doesnt really solve the problem (as i understand it)?i can also look at it a bit more and see if i have missed something anyway any suggestion/hint is greatly appreciated @siedlerchr  || hithanks for investigating the underlying problem is the latex2unicode (external library) kills the braces it has of course no understanding of an author refs  #4152 and #6155 i fear there is no easy solution we use the latexfree field method to not have latex code displayed in the main table #6329 i would treat this as a secondary issueregarding the second issue:> replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg the school of life -> l)what about using a formatter that uses the capital letters?  eg jabref would then become jrand orgs with abbreviations eg uno or who would stay as is similar to the title formatter || regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantif i understand things correctly there are currently three different cases relevant to #4337 and #4152assuming we are using the bibtex format described at [bibtexorg (special symbols)]( plain bibtex eg `kurt {g\""""od}el`: used as the internal representation?2 bibtex """"with unicode"""" eg `kurt {gÃ¶d}el`: used for exporting to a unicode-aware file format and editing in unicode?3 formatted text eg `k gÃ¶del`: used to display to a user or export to a latex/bibtex unaware environment`bibentrygetlatexfreefield` handles case 3 while to the best of my knowledge no function/method handles case 2the issue with case 2 is that latex and bibtex are two incompatible """"languages"""" (since some reserved words are the same) therefore if we are using the format described at [bibtexorg (format)]( the """"correct"""" way of dealing with case 2 using `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` is to either split out the latex components and """"translate"""" them to unicode separately or to escape the parts that are in bibtex format  if i am using the [bibtexorg format]( at least all non-nested curly bracketsl not preceded by a keyword should be escaped* `{jabref}` -> `\{jabref\}` * `proceedings of the {ieee}` -> `proceedings of the \{ieee\}`which is then dealt with correctly in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield`what i was trying to argue is that case 2 and case 3 must be dealt with differently i can deal with this after issue #6459 if that is of interest?**however i just realized that issue #6459 is case 3 and can most likely be solved by changing the order of method calls** please point out if something is unclear or incomprehensible i am trying to improve my writing skills but i am well aware that i have some practice ahead of me my only excuse is that it is still morning here x) || regarding the second issue that does sound better i cant think of any case where keeping all capitalized letters isnt good and it should be compatible with the current implementation || >regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantno problem :) we are happy for every contributor its just a complex issue its just complicated issue because it involves corporate authors and unicodei try to provide some background on this: **unicode**:originally bibtex and latex did not support unicode thats why you have to use those latex-escaping of umlauts and other charactersbiblatex the successor of bibtex supports unicode but many journals still require bibtexand many citations from online resources still contain latex-escaping of charactersoriginally jabref maintained a bidirectional mapping between latex escaped characters and their unicode equivalent some time ago we switched to the [latex2unicode library]( of course javafx has no idea of latex therefore having a title or an author encoded in latex must obviously converted to unicode for displayeg > `kurt {g\""""od}el` becomes `kurt gÃ¶del`**corporate authors**:see the [biblatex manual]( section 233 corporate authors and editors:>corporate authors and editors are given in the author or editor field respectivelynote that they must be wrapped in an extra pair of curly braces to prevent data parsing from treating them as personal names which are to be dissected into their components example: `author {{national aeronautics and space administration}}`in jabref the latex2unicode formatter is called for **every field** and the formatter now receives the `string toconvert  {national aeronautics and space administration}` the latex2unicode formatter now kills the curly braces as they could indicate some latex commands and returns `string converted  national aeronautics and space administration`jabref now splits the author according to it rules and thinks its in this case two authors separated by authors the only solution i see is to check if its a corporate authors convert it to unicode and add the braces again one really difficult edge case is for example  ` author  {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}` could be easily interpreted as corporate authorsi hope my long explanation helps you a bit to understand the problem maybe you come up with an idea  || hello @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  thank you for your work in fixing this issue! and thanks for that informative context @siedlerchr  thats a very interesting edge case i think there could be a test where braces are counted to corroborate that the brace at the very beginning is not closed earlier on (that would be the case where formatting as a corporate author would apply i think)i have some code in python that does something related (though the opposite: it matches the most ancient parenthesis first) ill adapt it when i return

society but instead using Å‚ukasz michaÅ‚ as part of a corporate author name)im not familiar with jabrefs whole codebase so mismatched braces may be caught earlier on as per: is an example displayed as a test where one of the entries would throw an error (the last one):```java@test void testisincurlybrackets() {    /** correct     * c        : {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}     * brackets : 1  210

case:```java/**  * checks if the given string has exactly one pair of surrounding curly braces <br>  * strings with escaped characters in curly braces at the beginning and end are respected too  *

on?*`bracketedpatterngenerateinstitutionkey` gets called for any author enclosed in curly brackets (eg `""""{the school of life}""""`) the method expects an institute of technology or university and appends its name to the key (eg null if there is no name)*why is it going on?*academic institutions can have long generated bibtex keys unless abbreviated eg `""""royal institute of technology: the school of electrical engineering and computer science""""` which `generateinstitutionkey` shortens to `riteecs`*fix*replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg `the school of life` -> `l`)*what are alternatives?*1 regex matching universities and technological institutions which is hard to implement correctly on the other hand the drawback is an unexpected bibtex key in a corner case in the case of `the school of life` would be abbreviated to `sl` instead of `l`**2 fix to the author column**when the list of authors gets converted to a latex-free version all curly brackets are removed since the whole string is parsed as latex when the latex-free string is used to create/fetch an `authorlist` it will no longer contain any brackets and the information needed to format the string is gone**3 what i think is left to do**-  find out why `{the school of life}`  isnt respected in the author field of the gui-  ~~attempt to match universities etc with regex~~ assume that names that have comma separated parts are universities-  ~~update `bibtexkeygeneratortest` as it makes heavy use of deprecated methods~~ the deprecated methods are essentially convenience methods so they have been moved inside the test file-  see if the readability of `generateinstitutionkey` can be improved-  ~~change the key generator for

that the latex2unicode convert is called for the author field it kills the extra braces i had a similar problem in the msoffice exporter  i think i implemented a workaround there || ah nice thank you! i will take a look! || i believe this is fixable in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` by splitting it into bibtex/latex according to whichever bibtex version are supported but the problems are1 i cant find which bibtex version we are supporting in [adr]( nor anywhere else2 `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` appears to be used both for bibtex in utf-8 (eg `""""{lÃ¢tÃ«x}""""`) and for fully """"expanded"""" text (eg `""""lÃ¢tÃ«x""""`) as those are incompatible perhaps it makes sense to split the method and track down what method wants what?3 should i do this?4 i can attempt to do the same workaround but it doesnt really solve the problem (as i understand it)?i can also look at it a bit more and see if i have missed something anyway any suggestion/hint is greatly appreciated @siedlerchr  || hithanks for investigating the underlying problem is the latex2unicode (external library) kills the braces it has of course no understanding of an author refs  #4152 and #6155 i fear there is no easy solution we use the latexfree field method to not have latex code displayed in the main table #6329 i would treat this as a secondary issueregarding the second issue:> replace a null valued university with an empty string the drawback is potentially very short bibtex keys (eg the school of life -> l)what about using a formatter that uses the capital letters?  eg jabref would then become jrand orgs with abbreviations eg uno or who would stay as is similar to the title formatter || regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantif i understand things correctly there are currently three different cases relevant to #4337 and #4152assuming we are using the bibtex format described at [bibtexorg (special symbols)]( plain bibtex eg `kurt {g\""""od}el`: used as the internal representation?2 bibtex """"with unicode"""" eg `kurt {gÃ¶d}el`: used for exporting to a unicode-aware file format and editing in unicode?3 formatted text eg `k gÃ¶del`: used to display to a user or export to a latex/bibtex unaware environment`bibentrygetlatexfreefield` handles case 3 while to the best of my knowledge no function/method handles case 2the issue with case 2 is that latex and bibtex are two incompatible """"languages"""" (since some reserved words are the same) therefore if we are using the format described at [bibtexorg (format)]( the """"correct"""" way of dealing with case 2 using `bibentrygetlatexfreefield` is to either split out the latex components and """"translate"""" them to unicode separately or to escape the parts that are in bibtex format  if i am using the [bibtexorg format]( at least all non-nested curly bracketsl not preceded by a keyword should be escaped* `{jabref}` -> `\{jabref\}` * `proceedings of the {ieee}` -> `proceedings of the \{ieee\}`which is then dealt with correctly in `bibentrygetlatexfreefield`what i was trying to argue is that case 2 and case 3 must be dealt with differently i can deal with this after issue #6459 if that is of interest?**however i just realized that issue #6459 is case 3 and can most likely be solved by changing the order of method calls** please point out if something is unclear or incomprehensible i am trying to improve my writing skills but i am well aware that i have some practice ahead of me my only excuse is that it is still morning here x) || regarding the second issue that does sound better i cant think of any case where keeping all capitalized letters isnt good and it should be compatible with the current implementation || >regarding the first issue first of all as you know i am not a regular contributor to jabref if youd like me to drop this topic for any reason please say so i am just hoping that sorting this out will save someone else time in the future but i am not familiar enough with jabref to know if i have missed something importantno problem :) we are happy for every contributor its just a complex issue its just complicated issue because it involves corporate authors and unicodei try to provide some background on this: **unicode**:originally bibtex and latex did not support unicode thats why you have to use those latex-escaping of umlauts and other charactersbiblatex the successor of bibtex supports unicode but many journals still require bibtexand many citations from online resources still contain latex-escaping of charactersoriginally jabref maintained a bidirectional mapping between latex escaped characters and their unicode equivalent some time ago we switched to the [latex2unicode library]( of course javafx has no idea of latex therefore having a title or an author encoded in latex must obviously converted to unicode for displayeg > `kurt {g\""""od}el` becomes `kurt gÃ¶del`**corporate authors**:see the [biblatex manual]( section 233 corporate authors and editors:>corporate authors and editors are given in the author or editor field respectivelynote that they must be wrapped in an extra pair of curly braces to prevent data parsing from treating them as personal names which are to be dissected into their components example: `author {{national aeronautics and space administration}}`in jabref the latex2unicode formatter is called for **every field** and the formatter now receives the `string toconvert  {national aeronautics and space administration}` the latex2unicode formatter now kills the curly braces as they could indicate some latex commands and returns `string converted  national aeronautics and space administration`jabref now splits the author according to it rules and thinks its in this case two authors separated by authors the only solution i see is to check if its a corporate authors convert it to unicode and add the braces again one really difficult edge case is for example  ` author  {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}` could be easily interpreted as corporate authorsi hope my long explanation helps you a bit to understand the problem maybe you come up with an idea  || hello @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  thank you for your work in fixing this issue! and thanks for that informative context @siedlerchr  thats a very interesting edge case i think there could be a test where braces are counted to corroborate that the brace at the very beginning is not closed earlier on (that would be the case where formatting as a corporate author would apply i think)i have some code in python that does something related (though the opposite: it matches the most ancient parenthesis first) ill adapt it when i return

refactoring thats a very clever function!however i think i found an edge case where `isincurlybrackets` may present a false positive in its current form (inspired by the corporate author kurt gÃ¶del society but instead using Å‚ukasz michaÅ‚ as part of a corporate author name)im not familiar with jabrefs whole codebase so mismatched braces may be caught earlier on as per: is an example displayed as a test where one of the entries would throw an error (the last one):```java@test void testisincurlybrackets() {    /** correct     * c        : {\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}     * brackets : 1  210             10     * count    : 1  112             22     */    assertfalse(stringutilisincurlybrackets(""""{\l{}}ukasz micha\l{}""""))    /** correct     * c        : {{\l{}}ukasz micha\l{} society}     * brackets : 12  321             21        0     * count    : 11  111             11        1     */    asserttrue(stringutilisincurlybrackets(""""{{\l{}}ukasz micha\l{} society}""""))    /** mismatched braces should return false?     * c        : {{\l{}}ukasz micha\l{} {society}     * brackets : 12  321             21 2       1     * count    : 11  111             11 1       1     */    assertfalse(stringutilisincurlybrackets(""""{{\l{}}ukasz micha\l{} {society}""""))}```in case this isnt filtered  checkbraces` then checking the final value of `brackets  0` could prevent that edge case:```java/**  * checks if the given string has exactly one pair of surrounding curly braces <br>  * strings with escaped characters in curly braces at the beginning and end are respected too  * @param tocheck the string to check  * @return true if the check was succesful false otherwise  */ public static boolean isincurlybrackets(string tocheck) {     int count  0     int brackets  0     if ((tocheck  null) || tocheckisempty()) {         return false     } else {         if ((tocheckcharat(0)  {) && (tocheckcharat(tochecklength() - 1)  })) {             for (char c : tochecktochararray()) {                 if (c  {) {                     if (brackets  0) {                         count++                     }                     brackets++                 } else if (c  }) {                     brackets--                 }             }             return count  1 && brackets  0         }         return false     } }``` || @rolandog  thanks for testing and checking that edge case feel free to submit a new pr and in that way you can also fix the workaround i used in the msbibauthor for the ms office exporter  || """"curly brackets are not respected (in the maintables author column?)"""" is the same as issue #6465should i leave it alone in this pr or update this one to close both? || since they are related you can update your pr to close both just add it also to the changelog then  || i am having issues finding a case that is supposed to break the method `fixauthornatbiblatexfree` ill look at it a bit longer before extending the same tests to the other methods but i dont think i will come up with anythingother than that i cant find any tests for `bibentrytableviewmodel` nor `maintablenameformatter` i dont think i should attempt to create any as at least `bibentrytableviewmodel` has gone through quite a bit of changes recently || if you cant find a case thats breaking the test its a good sign )regarding tests for other classes i think this would be beyond the scope of the pr here || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27  as you now have some more deep insights into the bibtexkeypattern generation now than i can you maybe help that usere here in the forum?  || sure i will look at it i somehow missed that jabref has a forum oo || so what remains are1 preferences no longer updates without restart (eg from none to natbib) that is not within the scope of the pr and i am guessing someone is fixing it already2 weird things happens if you try to escape curly brackets in the author section of required fields i am guessing the \ is being protected somewhere i can open up an issue about it but i dont have time to look at it until the 1th of may || thanks already for your contribution and the extensive tests just let me know if its finished so far then we can review it it would be nice if you could open an issue for the two problems especially that preferences reloading i guess escaping the curly brackets should hopefully be not that common in the author field more relevant for the title field or so i guess  || > i just saw two minor style issues nitpicks but nothing importanti am trying to learn and improve nitpicking is appreciated and encouraged! :) || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27 big thanks for your work on thisi just noticed some latex commands are not cleared in the now-master-buildhas this been an issue before / is this still an issue with latex2unicodeadapter?( library is jabrefauthors in src/test/resources/testbib || which ~~file in particular~~  and which ~~settings~~ entry table """"format of author and editor name""""? || hum i am not sure what is going on ill have a look || most of those should be """"cleared"""" and are cleared when i build locally but that might be something wrong with my setup || looks fine for me as well:( lastname option and do not abbreviateedit// @calixtus  do you have """"show names unchanged"""" activated?  || i think i could reproduce @calixtus screenshot in jabref 51--2020-05-28--ffa07cd but right now i seem unable to do so again (and i have tried) || @k3kaw8pnf7mkmdsmphz27 if you have """"show names unchanged"""" in the prefs activated then no conversion is happening || i see so the solution would be to change `return nametoformat` to `return latex2unicodeadapterformat(nametoformat)` or similar in maintablenameformatter || @calixtus i thought the intent of that option was to leave the names completely unchanged?also if you change that dont forget to add a cacheeditwith cache i mean something along the line of `private string authorsnatbiblatexfree` in `authorlist` || uh im not going to change anything today ðŸ˜„ i was just wondering about that || hum actually that is my bad jabref 50 does indeed """"clear"""" the latex even when `show names unchanged` is set should i open up an issue and fix this then?  || yes it would be nice if you could provide a fix (no need to create an issue before) || ok i apparently dont know how to do this i created [ || well thank you all for reviewing this pr it is very appreciated! â¤ï¸ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽˆill take the reviews and results to heart and make sure the next pr will create fewer issues ðŸ¤¦  ||

i mean except for tests the pr itself is done unless `authorlistparser` should be refactored into an inner-class (and i dont know if that is a good idea) || i am looking into it! it will take a couple of days as i have a limited time during the weekend i have some ideas i want to try out to simplify/compartmentalize code and if they dont pan out or are tedious to review they should be easy to rollback || i am not sure if i should continue with the changes id like to try except for- """"formatting should be handled by the nameformatter""""- """" cache the getmaintablenameformatpreferences""""i was looking into making `authorlist` a `list` hence all `list` methods become available in particular i found `listsublist()` and `liststream()` to be useful**however the changes i am considering are becoming more and more out of the scope of the original issue and if i continue there will be a lot of code changes to review so i figured ill let you chime in on if i should stop**a natural extension of having `authorlist` as a `list` is to put formatting responsibilities into one `authorformatter` that can take `enum` arguments such as `displaystyle` `namestyle` `conjugationstyle` along the lines of ```javapublic static string format(string authors namestyle namestyle                            displaystyle displaystyle conjugationstyle conjugationstyle) {    list<string> authornames  authorlistparserparse(authors)stream()        map(namestyle::format)        map(displaystyle::format)        map(latextounicodeadapter::format)        collect(collectorstolist())    return conjugationstylejoin(authors)}```it would allow most author `formatters` in `org/jabref/logic/layout/format/` to be seen as special cases an example would be `authorfirstfirst` which could be `authorformatterformat(string authors namestyledefault displaystylefirstname_first conjugationstylecommas)`some negative aspects- it is of course computationally slower than the current solution i havent gotten any benchmark/profiler result so i cant tell exactly how much slower- for the display style to be meaningful it would have to be quite verbose eg `displaystylefirst_von_last_comma_jr`other thoughts- i use `enums` as it reflects a users preferences well and with the current code base almost all styles are known at compile time  classes/objects would allow for more flexibility- caching of gui `string`s can be done in a similar way as now it can also be made more """"targeted"""" eg only caching the users current settings (o(1) lookup o(\log n) collision) and calling `weakhashmapclear()` on an update to the users settings- i have done â‰ˆ 30% of the needed changes- it would allow the """"natbib style"""" to be a special case in preferences rather than its own style- i consider splitting the """"responsibility"""" with `displaystyle` `namestyle` and `conjugationstyle` to be more readable/understandable than the different versions of `authorlistfixauthorlatexfree()` despite the difference between `displaystyle` and `namestyle` not being obviousi consider myself having learned more about java and jabref attempting to implement this so i am happy discarding these additional changes based on performance/review/out-of-scope/maintainability/* reasons as always any feedback is welcome and appreciated! || thanks a lot for this thoughtful proposal i like it a lot and the (pseudo)code you proposed looks really neat and understandable so i advocate that you go ahead and implement it like thisa few remarks though:- please do this in a new pr this one is already pretty huge so i would propose to finish it first and do the bigger revision in a new one- most of these special author formatters are actually pretty old and already deprecated by *the* [`authors` formatter]( according to the help this is the case since 27 so 9 years i think its the time to say goodbye to these old legacy formatters and cleanup the code accordingly (@jabref/developers ok with everyone?)- the performance problems are coming manly from the latex2unicode parser so this should be cached whenever possible so for the authors (whose parsing is already cached) it would be a good choice to store the latex-free version of the author names parts in the `author` class (maybe its actually enough to only store the latex-free version - would make the interface easier but im not sure if this is possible indeed) - i think it would be a good idea if `authorlist` implements `list` shouldnt also be too hard to implement since there is already a private field of `list<author>` so you just need to pass all methods through to it || ok! after this pr ill take an extra look at the different formatters and write up a bit more details in a new pr with extra attention to how all the flexibility of `format/authors` fits into the picture || "";;;;1;1;fix javadoc adherence with authorequals;"

|| sure shouldnt be too hard - the hard part is to understand the style and the idea/implementation of jabrefs pre-defined types the code itself will be may be 10 to 50 loc || cool> the hard part is to understand the style and the idea/implementation of jabrefs pre-defined typesi was just going through the code at avery high level  figured adding the new _biblatex-software_ entries to the `standardfield`  enum would make it available for `bibentryjava` am i on the right track ? || does the gui behave differently then? - this is a good first issue because one needs to go through the code and understand whats happening why and why somewthing does not happen if one changes something i assume you know the """"call hierarchy"""" feature etc? ctrl+mouse-click || > does the gui behave differently then?ah it did not so i was wrong ! i think i am getting the hang of it  i was looking at the code  so a new entry for each of  `biblatex-software` extensions - software- software versions- software modules - code fragmentsneed to appear in the `new entry` pane  with the corresponding fields from the style documentation an entry for software is already there  the others need to be added to the biblatex entry definitions along with their fields and types the gui renders all that is defined  ill go ahead and add/make those changes  along with unit tests ?> this is a good first issue because one needs to go through the code and understandagreed  i am new to jabref and oss contribution  hopefully i am in the right path getting know the codebaseedit: the software entry that is in existence does not seem to be the same entry as in biblatex-software (the fields vary)  what do we do here || the """"software"""" might come from the ieee style could you make a table showing the different fields column a: field name column b field in ieee present (exiting in jabref) column c field present in biblatex-software then a cross if it exists empty else?it would be helpful if the examples of  were included in the tests maybe as a bib file in  think we need a divider in the menu (as we have for ieee dont we?) screenshots should be at  but we currently dont have onethe other alternative is to add refine the howto for [customize entry types]( and ship a bib file with the customization included so that each user can load it if he wants to use biblatex-softwarei find software that important so that we should ship support with jabref as defaultif possible could you also add an [adr]( containing the options """"native support in jabref"""" and """"support via customized entry types""""?

is a local object  in fact its similar to the classical eventlistener in gui an even its relayed to its parend until its handled the only difference is that we do this relaying here manuallywhen you add a new event in bibentry you have to relay that to the call chain the corasechangefilter register itself here: registers itselt as a listener on bibdatabaseand bibdatabase finally register itself on each entry: you need to listen for the focuschangedevent and relay that || thank you for your help finally i deleted all `focuseventchanged`-related stuff and concentrated on `coarsechangefilter`there i introduced a `delaytaskthrottler` for the `eventbuspost(event)` also i revised the conditionals while introducing three conditions:- `isnewedit`: editing right after loading shared database- `iseditonotherfield`: editing other field  changes on previous field should be synchronized- `ismajorchange`: some editing with much character inputi found out that a throttled task will not interrupt any input that means if a `fieldchangedevent` is posted with delay you can write further until database synchronization appears in the worst case you lose some information because all characters typed in after the event are not synchronized furthermore it appears that when the event is posted during delay jabref hangs upcan you reproduce this problems? in general it works as intendedanother idea: what about throttling _all_ `fieldchangeevent`s in order to not interrupt input process? then we would have to ensure that all pending synchronization events would be ready before closing the database we could add an indicator in the gui for this purpose or add something on closing-database event || side note: we have an internal discussion ongoing why not using javafx observables everywhere - instead of the event bus not fully checked all aspects until now will (hopefully) be done at [jabcon]( do you have a """"feeling"""" on that? || i have not much experience with javafx observables but it seems like they are directly bound to gui elementsthus events maybe could only be fired less in accordance to the gui on the other hand it would be an advantage to use gui events from everywhere with little efforti think the `coarsechangefilter` would become obsolete wouldnt it?so why not giving observables a try  || thanks a lot @m-mauersberger!

      you can download the development version at:       please make a backup of your library before you try out this version      if you already use a development version ensure that you use the latest one -->-  i have tested the latest development version from  and the problem persists<!-- add a clear and concise description of what the bug is -->steps to reproduce the behavior:1 connect to postgresql db with â‰ˆ3400 entries2 see that it takes over 8 minutes the database has still not loaded completely this is on a very fast server the internet connection from here is only about 1 mb/s download however loading the same bibtex file off a shared drive from the same server takes only a few seconds saving my 3400 entries to the remote database also took hours and hours and jabref consumed something like 8 gb of memory while doing thiswould it be worth trying a mysql db instead?<!-- if applicable add excerpt of the bibliography file screenshot and excerpt of log (available in the error console) --><details>  <summary>log file</summary>    ```  paste an excerpt of your log file here  ```</details>;""i also have long processing times with a smaller database of about 600 entries about half an hour to paste 600 entries to the remote postgresql db when creating the tables then it takes about 2 min to open itthis occurs on both versions 431 and 382 || i am interested in working on this issue to recreate the problem i could set up a test postgresql database on heroku (a paas ive used before) and fill it with bibtex entries with a script then i could try to load the entries as described is there anything i should know before getting started? || we have some database related tests they might be a good starting point  i would wait until  is merged this pr already improves the db performance and maybe this fixes this issue as well || any other issues i can work on? i wanted to take a break from javafx but if theres not a strong need i can work on the importer dialog feel free to move this conversation to gitter || i think there may be two issues related to the db requests:  - single requests can be quite slow and make the user wait solution: speed can be improved or it could be an idea to let the user continue using jabref before requests end  - some operations seem to generate many db requests: they could be grouped to be sent as a single requestregarding the second point these operations seem to be concerned (from what i have tested):  - opening the remote db  - pasting or deleting multiple entries at once  - pasting a bibtex source that contains several fields || unfortunately this issue is known the synch is done way too many times i think there should be one or more duplicate issues for this already || i played around with python (using the psycopg2 library) to access my jabref (postgresql) database remotely i have â‰ˆ4000 entries but i was surprised how blazingly fast this went via python getting all keys or all filenames of attached pdfs or all group information for all entries â€” it all happened within very few seconds or even fractions of a second this compares to minutes that many jabref operations take this definitely gives me an idea that there is a lot of room for improvementmy requests pulled many entries from the db at once rather than doing many individual reads not sure if its of any help here and i really dont have much experience with databases at all but i thought id mention it || @schniepp is it problem still exist? || issue should still persist || @norwaymaple do you want to work on it?  || @ali96kz im looking into this how do i find the keystore i need? do you recommend i use something along the lines of `keytool -genkey`? || @schniepp @stefan-kolb are you sure the issue still exists in the latest development version? if im not mistaken @ali96kz recently implemented some huge improvements to the performanceit would be nice if you could try out the [latest development version]( before @norwaymaple invests time in trying to fix it  for me tests on the latest windows built with a remote postgresql server show the problem described in the issue is solved but there are still many actions that remain slow:- opening a db: now fast (a few seconds for a few hundreds of entries)- editing a field: still slow as i type the first character (~5 s) a bit faster for the second character then it gets faster and good as i continue typing- pasting in the bibtex tab an entry containing several fields: still very slow (1-2 min)- switching tabs: takes a few seconds || connecting to a remote postgresql db with â‰ˆ3900 entries took 30 seconds for jabref to show the entries in the windowexporting the same database as a *bib file and opening this file from the same server (via mounted network share) using the same network connection took exactly the same time: 30 seconds so in response to my original problem this is definitely a huge improvement! thank you so much! it is well usable now! i apologize for my late response as i have been totally overloaded at work || is this issue still needing work? i left off trying to connect jabref to an external postgres and debugging a error relating to a root certificate || @norwaymaple  regarding the cert stuff have a look here:  here for the server side: || btw  can someone of you working with the shared databse reproduce this issue? #4804 || @siedlerchr thanks for the links basically when i try to connect jabref says it cannot find `/users/abe/postgresql/rootcrt` but i dont have a directory `/users/abe/postgresql` and i have set environmental variable `$pghome` is set to somewhere else || @norwaymaple there are still the slowdowns mentioned in my previous comment @schniepp have you tried in your tests doing other tasks than just opening the database? in particular anything that writes on the db would be interesting if these write-related problems should be considered as a separate issue i can open one || @siedlerchr i looked at the page on setting up the postgres ssl client and it looks like it is not using """"javas default mechanism"""" for connecting to ssl that uses

""""path to the file""""? how did you overwrite the path settings? || postgres apparently looks for the certificate files in the home folder per defaultin pgadmin you can adjust the server properties regarding ssl and specify the paths to the certificate files thats what i meant with overwriting file directory as you can see from my screenshot i put all certs in one folder and then i adjusted the server properties to point to that folder(im running postgres on same machine as jabref)  || @norwaymaple @siedlerchr: if you have issues setting up a database you can use a third party service for which there is little manual configuration to do for tests i think thats good enough i have just tried [elephantsql]( with their free 20 mb plan and it just takes 5 min to get it to work with jabref (and it shows similar slowdowns as my previous tests) || i considered elephantsql for the database but i had wanted to use heroku because i have used it for other things beforeon a side note when i turn the internet switch off on my computer i get a different error that says i cant connect so it must be at least trying to set up ssl with the remote server the exception is being thrown at  i dont see how this error could _not_ be thrown unless you have the root certificate in `$home/postgresql/rootcrt` or `%appdata%\postgresql\rootcrt` or have `sslrootcert` set in the properties (see  jabref does not set that property so far as i can tell (see below)  || i tried using elephantsql and the same error arose i checked my filesystem for `rootcrt` and didnt come up with anything would you be able to check your `${userhome}/postgresql/` in *nix systems or `%appdata%/postgresql/` for windows and let me see if your `rootcrt` is there? also i added more logging to the branch at my fork when you connect to the database using the version at  what is printed to standard out that does not go through jabrefs logger? || @norwaymaple  are you sure you have put the rootcrt on the **server** file system? || i have not how would i generate that file? i can also look into how i would put it onto the serveras a side note i am currently in the process of trying to install openssl on my macos in order to create a self-signed certificate it has been difficult because i have tried to install from the tarball and it may be interfering with another `openssl` binary from an anaconda distribution i installed separately || @norwaymaple  i think that you are missing the certs on your server: you need to either generate them on the server side or upload them using ftp/scp or whatever you have problems generating them you can use mine:[certspostgreszip]( || i think i figured out what the problem with trying to connect jabref to heroku postgres is it works out that heroku does not negotiate with ca-verifiable certificates but the postgres jdbc wants to connect with `sslmode` set to `verify-full` i am going to try another database || ive looked into this in the context of deleting ~50 entries from a shared database am i mistaken that they are deleted one by one with ~50 database queries? it looks like `orgjabreflogicshareddbmssynchronizerlisten(entryremovedevent event)` is run ~50 times could that explain why this and other operations are so slow? || i am not familiar enough with the jabref source to determine what it does but i can look from the other side of the tunnel and log what queries are made to my postgresql server here are a log attachments corresponding to various tasks i performed on jabref 431**click on an entry place cursor somewhere in the title field and insert a character**[insert_1_charactertxt]( generates nine single statements and one `begin  commit` block!**click on an entry place cursor somewhere in the title field and type quickly 10 characters**[insert_10_characterstxt]( spits out a log of 210 lines! it does 10 times what was done for a single character**pasting 4 entries copied from a local jabref database**[pasting_4_entriestxt]( each entry and for each field a statement is executed to set the value! some extra statements are also present when switching from one entry to another**deleting 4 entries**[deleting_4_entriestxt]( are deleted one by one using several statements for each**creating a new article entry go to the bibtex tab and paste a bibtex entry**[add_empty_article_and_paste_bibtextxt]( field is set one by one and using many statements**general observations**there are many occurences of```statement: select 1::char```and```execute <unnamed>: select * from """"metadata""that may not be useful**conclusion**in all the cases above changes could be made using less statements@norwaymaple this answers part of your question: from my logs we can extrapolate that deleting 50 entries executes 50*7 statements ||  and now the same tests but with install jabref_windows-x64_5_0-dev--snapshot--2019-07-14--master--7561724b1exe:[insert_1_character_devtxt]( statements are a bit different but most of the comments in my previous post still hold: changes are not grouped into less statements and there are unnecessary queries || yeah i think as your analysis uncovered as well is the problem is that jabref generates a change event for each typed char a so called fieldchangeevent which is then send to the db as a statement @tobiasdiez  do you see any way to only send an even when the field is left?i think we had this before we changed the entry editor stuff  sql statements are build here: || would it also help to make it so insertions and deletions of multiple entries are executed in batches? || @bruot thanks a lot for the in-depth analysis that helps a lot! @siedlerchr  || im still looking into this it looks like events are being fired from `orgjabrefmodelentrybibentry` to `orgjabrefmodeldatabasebibdatabase` which is relays them to other classes but not to `orgjabrefmodeldatabasebibdatabasecontext` which is where `orgjabrefmodeleventcoarsechangefilter` is listening `orgjabreflogicshareddbmssynchronizer` listens to `coarsechangefilter` || i discovered that when you type for example 7 characters into a field in a shared database `orgjabrefmodeleventcoarsechangefilter` considers the delta between the old field contents and the new field contents to be 7 for each letter typed because each typed character fires a `fieldchangedevent` and each one has a delta of 7 characters each one passes through the filter and causes a sync with the shared database perhaps this is because i type them faster than the gui can update the field? either way it should only fire one event with a delta of 7 characters or 7 events with a delta of one character (which would be stopped by the filter and prevented from causing a database sync) || the issue i mentioned above seems to be  however entries are still updated one at a time this appears to be because when you update multiple entries they are updated in a `for` loop each iteration fires an event which is listened to  dbmssynchronizer` `dbmssychronizer` makes one database query per event therefore if you delete 1000 entries 1000 events are fired this is one of the reasons bulk operations take so longat least some of the `for` loops are in `orgjabrefguibasepanel` which means they are also responsible for local database updates the only two ways i can think of to solve this problem are to change the `for` loops to account for firing fewer events to update remote databases or to aggregate events so that dbmssychronizer combines all the fired events into one query changing the `for` loops would mean changing code that is used by the rest of the app and i dont know if theres a clean way of aggregating events i can be more specific if that helpsdoes anyone have ideas on this? || @norwaymaple feel free to change the for loops to batch operations (such as `addall` or `removeall`) the code in basepanel is everything than sacred (in the contrary you are happily invited to refactor it as much as you want - its still one of the most dark and dangerous alleys in the jabref code world) i have no idea how updates to many entries (ie changing the value of a field) should be combined/aggregated these operations currently trigger an update of the ui and thus also lead to performance problems in a usual non-shared environment || @tobiasdiez i started writing the code to batch remove entries i ended up changing `entryremovedevent` to `entriesremovedevent` and changing the code wherever it was subscribed to that event it doesnt compile because i havent finished this is actually more of a refactoring of the entry events overall than specifically something that relates to database syncs also i still have to look into if the tests need to be changed i pushed it to a branch on my fork linked below would you be interested in me making a pr for this? || @norwaymaple  sounds good please  create  a pr  so we can look at the changes || sorry about any inconvenience caused herei am replicating the discussion that moved ahead in my repo (and will remove the repo to avoid further confusion) || @schniepp said:anyway my largest issue in connecting with the db is not longer the read/write performance but an issue where doing certain bulk operations would just create to a completely hanging jabref instance the only solution in these cases is to kill jabref and restart it i happens more often with a slow internet connection than with a fast one i usually see this when i am trying to move certain entries into a particular group (say 20 or so) in some cases it will do it for the first 4 or so and then get completely stuckbut unfortunately this is not reproducible sometimes it will not complete a single one and in other times all 20 will go through in a reasonably short time || @norwaymaple said:thanks for the feedback do you mean that the issue used to be read/write performance but now that is no longer a problem? or that the issue was never read/write performance? || @schniepp said:@norwaymaple: in the beginning it was indeed a performance issue the biggest performance issue got resolved indeed i believe i was the one who originally reported above that loading from a db with 3900 entries became as fast as loading the same entries from a *bib file this became possible after some of the fixes that were implemented in response to this reportonce this was fixed using the db remotely actually became a viable option for me i believe this is what enabled the discovery of the hanging/crashing issue perhaps this should be a separate report? but to some extent i was under the impression we are discussion various db related issues in this thread anyway || either way - we can use this thread or another one right now im making a fix to batch entry synchronization but i can look into the hanging operation later || this issue has been inactive for half a year since jabref is constantly evolving this issue may not be relevant any longer and it will be closed in two weeks if no further activity occursas part of an effort to ensure that the jabref team is focusing on important and valid issues we would like to ask if you could update the issue if it still persists this could be in the following form:- if there has been a longer discussion add a short summary of the most important points as a new comment (if not yet existing)- provide further steps or information on how to reproduce this issue- upvote the initial post if you like to see it implemented soon votes are not the only metric that we use to determine the requests that are implemented however they do factor into our decision-making process- if all information is provided and still up-to-date then just add a short comment that the issue is still relevantthank you for your contri"

in general it works as intendedanother idea: what about throttling _all_ `fieldchangeevent`s in order to not interrupt input process? then we would have to ensure that all pending synchronization events would be ready before closing the database we could add an indicator in the gui for this purpose or add something on closing-database event || side note: we have an internal discussion ongoing why not using javafx observables everywhere - instead of the event bus not fully checked all aspects until now will (hopefully) be done at [jabcon]( do you have a """"feeling"""" on that?

so as not to lose the information in case of ambiguity but this would inevitably result in wrong data in the _doi_ field sometimes when the _url_ field is eg ** or when the field _note_ reads eg

would already be a great improvementanother option is to query doi validity (i think theres already something like this in automatically searching for dois for an entry)  if the matched doi isnt valid (i dont think 10/summary is for example) then it shouldnt move it to the doi field || >    one isnt matched because theres no 10 though right?exactly! thats the 2nd problemok yes validating the doi is of course the obvious solution to this problem thanks for the idea!i have quite a busy week ahead but i should have found some time by the end of the week! :) || please keep in mind that the cleanup

|| i think the hotkey for pulling changes is important for databases that do not support pushing || for me the same i would keep it mh what about `strg+alt+r` or `alt+shift+r` for pull changes? || looks like `alt+shift+r` can be usedill test it tomorrow on mac & windows  || seems like `alt+shift+r` is okin case if no more comments ill create a pull request || ouch ))ive created a pull request and it shows 56 commits and 2 files change looks like this is because i created the branch from my master but it should be created from jabref/master is that a problem? if yes i will create a new commit || "";1;0;add whitespace in keybindingrepository;"

then we can discuss this more easily about autosave: @siedlerchr is most experienced with this part of the code || @houssemnasri  the autosave / tab shutdown closing seems plausible and should be donea tab has an attach bibdatabasecontext so this is correct || i am trying a new approach by adding a new tab with 0 entries then when data is ready i call a method from librarytab to update bibdatabasecontext but the problem is that groups pane doesnt update and keep showing 0 entries although when i navigate away from the tab and come back it updates just finethis is the method in librarytab to update bibdatabasecontext ```javapublic void feeddata(bibdatabasecontext bibdatabasecontext){        cleanup()        thisbibdatabasecontext  objectsrequirenonnull(bibdatabasecontext)        bibdatabasecontextgetdatabase()registerlistener(this)        bibdatabasecontextgetmetadata()registerlistener(this)        thissidepanemanager  framegetsidepanemanager()        thistablemodel  new maintabledatamodel(getbibdatabasecontext() preferencesservice globalsstatemanager)        citationstylecache  new citationstylecache(bibdatabasecontext)        annotationcache  new fileannotationcache(bibdatabasecontext preferencesservicegetfilepreferences())        setupmainpanel()        setupautocompletion()        thisgetdatabase()registerlistener(new searchlistener())        thisgetdatabase()registerlistener(new entriesremovedlistener())        // ensure that at each addition of a new entry the entry is added to the groups interface        thisbibdatabasecontextgetdatabase()registerlistener(new grouptreelistener())        // ensure that all entry changes mark the panel as changed        thisbibdatabasecontextgetdatabase()registerlistener(this)        thisgetdatabase()registerlistener(new updatetimestamplistener(preferencesservice))        thisentryeditor  new entryeditor(this externalfiletypes)        platformrunlater(() -> {            easybindsubscribe(changedproperty this::updatetabtitle)            globalsstatemanagergetopendatabases()addlistener((listchangelistener<bibdatabasecontext>) c ->                    updatetabtitle(changedpropertygetvalue()))        })         //i took some code from add() method in jabrefframe to reinitialize backup and autosave        if (readyforautosave(bibdatabasecontext)) {            autosavemanager autosaver  autosavemanagerstart(bibdatabasecontext)            autosaverregisterlistener(new autosaveuimanager(this))        }        backupmanagerstart(thisbibdatabasecontext globalsentrytypesmanager globalsprefs)        trackopennewdatabase(this)    }``` || "";1;0;extracted jabrefpreferences  imports removed dead code shortened method name;"

that is highly counter-intuitive (from a user as well as developer standpoint) yml or json would have been a more logical choice- why do you require that the study file has to be in a git repository? doesnt this reduce possible use cases? moreover what happens if the user wants to see the new papers without pushing the repo? i would leave git management to the usermoreover we should think about how to improve the experience for users trying out the feature the first time right now they are confronted with a file selection dialog without any explanation of what they should actually select etc || thanks for the feedback :)!regarding the first  bullet point:one reason was that jabref already knew how to parse such a file making the implementation fairly easy additionally the entries can easily be modified directly in jabref therefore it was a straightforward choice this certainly is not the most user-friendly variant but this can and will be addressed by offering a gui for the creation of this file in the futureregarding the second bullet point:the reason for this is that this allows easy versioning of search sessions allowing to track new entries without reevaluating old entries i do not see how this could reduce the number of use cases? furthermore if the user does not want to create a remote repository for pushing a local one will suffice in case a remote repository is configured i do not see any use case where a search should not be documented?i agree that the ux is currently poor however with the gui implementation and the [existing documentation]( for the feature it should suffice :) || > one reason was that jabref already knew how to parse such a file making the implementation fairly easy i agree and think its a good short term solution however in the long term i would strongly favor a solution based on a different file format there are also parsers that can be reused easily> the reason for this is that this allows easy versioning of search sessions allowing to track new entries without reevaluating old entriesthat also works if the user manages the git repo on its own right?

then one can also manually remove false-positives etc before committhe user creates a separate branch (eg `jabref-slr-search`) the slr functionality prepends new entry thus there wont be any git merge conflicts when mergin the survey results into the own branch this merging has to be done manuallyin other words: the slr feature maintaines the branch `jabref-slr-search` the user maintains the other branches when a user wants to remove search results he does it in his branch with a commit message indicating why he removed the search result thus another person can trace what happened in the search:- what did the crawler find?- what did the user remove?future work: slr feature switches to branch `slr-search` searches commits and switches back to the branch before thus the user can choose an arbitrary branch name (such as `main`)> > i do not see how this could reduce the number of use cases?> many users dont even know what a git repository iswith the upcoming gui support jabref will create the git repository magically no external dependencies required the connection to an upstream repository is depatable maybe the thought-of target group is not that large as thought maybe a discussion with @xjreb could help here maybe we should really do not do any git magic (push/pull) but leave that to the usernevertheless i would keep the """"branch switchting magic"""" the slr feature only works at the branch `jabref-slr-search` || > the project had a time-constraint of 6 month with fixed costs thus we had to adjust the content that i fully understand and im impressed by what dominik accomplished in such a short time period i just wanted to point out that for the integration in jabref one needs to rethink a few of these decisions for example once we release a version that uses bib files as the study definition its way harder do later change it to say yaml because you have to think about migration etcfor the git support it would maybe be good if you could outline what the goal and the workflow looks like what are the use cases?for example> with the upcoming gui support jabref will create the git repository magicallywhy would i want to have this as a user?by skimming the code i couldnt see how jabref only maintains only the branch jabref-slr-search it looked like it operates on the currently selected branch and mostly commits everything (staged) - so even unrelated files in other directories that might be undesired/unexpected from a user perspective || "";;;;1;1;remove unused importssigned-off-by: dominik voigt <dominikingovoigt@gmailcom>;"

|| i am by no means an expert on these issues but my thoughts are1 regarding `shortauthor` i dont have much of an opinion since the institution key to the best of my understanding is a heuristic/convenience feature i dont see the drawback of using it2 id agree that the regex is a bit on the broad side> and even with an added abbrevation behind the full name the citekey is still wrongoupsie that is my fault latextounicodeadapter will interpret the `{()}` as a code-block which gets resolved to `()` which is likely what is going wrong as it wont be detected as an abbreviation anymore> we could parse the institutioni believe the name is being parsed around `` and later through (?<![\w\d])(university|uni)(?![\w\d])id be hesitant against making it too specific as well i dont really know what a good solution to this is id consider `^univ*` a possible """"solution"""" as well (unless there is an argument for only matching """"uni""""?) based on  it matches in almost the same number of languages i dont really have an opinion regarding having a hardcoded list || @tmrd993 are you looking into this issue?

about missing custom css file;""7177 """"java exception when trying to open the preferences with missing custom theme""""after some testing i found that there two main paths that could result in the same failure: the css file being missing before application start and changing the name of the css file while the application is running to resolve the latter i think the best approach is to check the custom css file existsthis is already done for the theme as used for most of the application however the preview viewer has its own css url logicrather than add file checking logic to the preview viewer i have refactored and moved the theme logic of preview viewer into theme so that all css url logic is encapsulated in that class i have also put the logic that checks that the url is valid and filters it to an optionalempty() into one new method additionalcsstoload() in place of the field of the same name this ensure that the file existence check is performed in all cases rather than just at construction of the theme objecti have kept the optional<url> field so there should be no overhead to this approach for the built in themes and only the minor and necessary overhead of file existence checking for the custom themefor manual testing i checked:- previews and overall appearance for default theme are correct after restart- previews and overall appearance for dark theme are correct after restart- previews and overall appearance with a custom theme with a valid name are correct after restart- live changes to the custom theme still work in general and for preview- rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct **before application start** the preview is no longer themed but there is no error- the preview theme is restored when the filename is restored to the configured value without restarting the application- restart rename custom theme so that the configured theme is no longer correct **while application is running** the preview remains themed (typically sized css themes are data url embedded and so survive file removal)these tests were run both with the gradle run task and on the built binary (rationale: gradle presents the dark theme as a file while the binary has it built in on a jrt: url so the results could be different)pr tasks:-  change in changelogmd described (if applicable)-  -  -  ~~ (for ui changes)~~ (n/a)-  [](

test coverage for theme live reloading the change to it was minor but this should cover all the changes now all being well from ci pipeline i will remove the draft status  i get an npe with the file watching themetest in the github ci pipeline that i dont get when running the test locally and the only thing i can see on the line with npe that could do that is closing the watchservice which functionally looks correct but perhaps is open to memory consistency issues so ive added volatile to the watchservice and i take a local copy to null check before closing in commit 9d77318184c30f934343b0f9a6760817b0e53976 || ive put a condition on that last test ive added so it only runs on windows ill try to figure out why it is behaving differently in the pipeline without holding up this pr as it is very likely a test artifact -- its quite complicated with needing to run up the file watching service and mock the javafx sceneive given a final quick manual test after the last commitfetcher tests fail with 429 too many requests probably just because im hammering the ci and this is usual i guess the failing of the authors is usual for a first contribution so nothing to worry aboutonly thing that i am unsure of is why the mac osx create installer task fails consistently if thats something i need to fix let me knowfrom my perspective happy for this to be given a final review and merge  @docrjp  the mac os will always fail because it requires some keys/secrets however githubaction does not pass these to forks linux and file watching/locking is a complex issue linux file system works completely different from windows eg there is no kind of lock for a filefetcher test are another non-related issue only relevant if you worked on them || i agree with @tobiasdiez  we should merge this one now as this is an improvement already bug has been  and especially extracting theme logic out of foreign classes is very good even though the theme architecture is not perfect

ðŸ˜„ ||;java exception when trying to open the preferences with missing custom theme;> `jabref 52--2020-12-09--d1fb9e2`when trying to open the preferences dialogue a java exception occurs:`cannot load orgjabrefguipreferencespreferencesdialog`;could solve the problem: obviously a broken path of the custom theme css (due to a change of the name of the folder containing the custom theme css) caused the exception after reinstalling the release version having been able to change all paths in this version (this version didnt have the custom theme feature) and reinstalling the current master branch version all works again maybe a better handling of broken paths could prevent such exceptions? || well will take a look at this unfortunately i believe this problem may sit deeper in the javafx library since the css are handled there we will see || im having a look at this as a first contribution attempti was able to reproduce the issue as reported:1 made up a nonsense path in the custom theme text box of the preferences dialog2 restarted app successfully3 clicked again on menu options -> preferences4 dialog box pops up with uncaught exception in javafx application thread including stack traceobservation: the bad css path does not affect the application overall only previews are impacted (and the preference dialog has a preview tab)after some code inspection and debugging i can see the reason for this jabrefpreferences has logic to check if the custom css file exists and store it as a url if it does otherwise no url is stored in the optional value this is what the application uses in general however the preview viewer bypasses this logic and directly parses the path which is exposed by a getterthat getter is also used for saving the settings so i think it should stayi successfully tried out a tentative fix: adding a second getter that exposes the url as processed by jabrefpreferences only if this url is set will the preview viewer use it however i would like to take a bit more time to consider if there is a better solution and get my head around the contribution guidelines before i submit a prone final thought i think that the preferences tab should show a validation hint when the file is missing it wouldnt have prevented this case because as i understand it the path was correct at the time of configuration and changed only later still i think it would help the user when their css file is moved or mistyped i am happy to create a separate issue for this and give it a go i dont think it should block the fix of the uncaught exception || hi @docrjp  thank you very much for diving into the code and creating a fix can you please create a pull request with your changes so its somewhat easier to discuss them? ||;1;0;fix use of paths

|| an update to this two years old issuei have recently come back to jabref and this issue still persisted in 51 since i had over a 1000 files that were unlinked i decided to revert to an old version to try thingsrecap of issue: i use the regular expression `**/*[title]*\\[extension]` to link files in the versions since september 2018 jabref could not find files that contained non-alphabetical (and non-numerical? not sure) characters in the title see examples above even a simple dash could not be handledi removed 51 and found and installed jabref version 36marking all of my over 2000 entries and hitting f7 (automatically set file links) it worked like a charm! suddenly my list of over a 1000 unlinked files was down to less than 200! the remaining unlinked files were easily  (eg title has a colon but filename has a semicolon since windows dont allow colons in filenames or filename was truncated due to a very long title stuff like that)i dont know what changed between version 36 and (presumably) version 4x to hinder a regular expression search containing non-alphabetical characters in the title (it didnt have an issue with such characters in the bibtexkey then but i didnt test it now)now that my entire library is linked ill happily come back to the latest version 52ill change the title of this issue to a better description || may i ask whether there is test data for this somewhere?- bib file- pdf files with the filenamesmaybe three bibtex entries and three unlinked files || [bib_pdfszip]( hope uploading a zip with pdfs and a bib file worksone of the files (young ea ) has numbers in the title i tried f7 with it and it worked so numbers should not be an issue || @tb77phd  i could reproduce the issue and it seems its done on purpose the """"dash"""" character addtional whitespace and other unwanted latex chars || is the issue that the title is needed unchanged? as @siedlerchr says `[title]` makes modifications to the title `[title]` should not so perhaps that works? (note that it does not """"resolve"""" latex)  || actually would `[title regex("""":"""""""""""")]` work? || huh i was not aware of a difference between [title] and [title] i tried right now and it worked when the issue was a dash in the filename it did not work when the issue was parentheses thanks for the suggestion! || ðŸ¤¦ that does make sense i missed that if i am not mistaken the expanded bracket will be interpreted as regexp so parenthesis will be seen as a regexp matching groups and probably you wont get any result at all if they are unmatched~in your current version you **might** be able to solve it using either """"\\\\q\\\\e"""" or """"\q\e"""" (match the content between literally instead of as a regexp) eg `\\q[title regex("""":"""""""""""")]\\e` see  for more details even if this workaround works (which i am not completely sure of)~ i believe this must be changed in the codeyou can escape parenthesises and brackets `()` using the `:regex("""""""""""""""")` modifier but i

but you can specify the datatype of the spinner in the declaration  as it appears in the log an `uncaughtexception` is raised because the thread hits an exception that is not caught (ie a number format exception since we parse a char) debugging the application i can see that the exception is thrown by the java thread library (which makes sense) but i cannot see where we should catch it note here that exception handling is already added when we click the save button (ie the check for an integer that is larger than 8 for the font size) but this bug happens before this step other possible fixes could however include:* change the editable property to false this would however mean that the user needs to press the up and down buttons multiple times* change the spinner to a simple text field then we can perform all the exception handling in the view/view modeli think it will be great if we can fix it without changing the gui so if anyone has any comments or might want to work on this issue just mention it here  || i have found a fix where you bind an event handler directly to the `textfield` of the spinner as returned  fontsizegeteditor()` the event handler is called when the <kbd>enter</kbd> key is pressed i know however that doing event handling directly on the controls can be a bit problematic since it is not reusable code a pull request will follow after i add some comments || i think i have found a solution based on the textformatter the trick is to not return null:freel free to improve this ```textformatter<integer> formatter  new textformatter<>(

confusing this is used to warn/prevent users if they try to generate a key using the """"generate key"""" button in the entry editor although the entry already has a key the use case is that after generating a new key old latex documents stop compiling and some users would like to prevent this as you see this has nothing to do with the importmaybe its better to add a checkbox in the import

prefer? || oh ive completely missed the mark then sorry about thatthe way i understood the description/discussion within the issue i presumed the overwrite existing keys- option was the one that governs whether the default `citationkey` of an imported entry is overwritten by a generated key based on user preferences or not (and wasnt working as intended) my badjust for my understanding in general: if the bibtex-source-string: ```@article{igor:2013eha  author         {igor kulikov}  title          {a new gpu-accelerated hydrodynamical code for numerical simulation of interacting galaxies}  year           {2013}  month          {11}  archiveprefix  {arxiv}  eprint         {13110861}  primaryclass   {astro-phim}}```` is being imported after a web search default behaviour would be to overwrite the `citationkey` of the `bibentry`-object with a generated key based on the pattern specified in `citationkeypattern`-preferences (eg `igor2013` in case of a default pattern of `[auth][year]`) if a user were to choose not to overwrite keys the `bibentry` would continue using `igor:2013eha` as its `citationkey`would that then be considered intended behaviour for an import?im afraid im not able to fully comprehend the """"cleanup preferences""""-solution youve mentioned so im definitely not fit to voice an opinion here ive just got a first very localised look at jabref while attempting to fix the mentioned issuenot sure about the protocol - would you like me to close this pr and await your decision on this topic? || > another idea would be to let the users specify a cleanup preset in the preferences that is applied after an importi like this option! i think it would address a lot of the confusion regarding when the citation key generator is used and what behavior it hashowever i dont think it replaces this pr i think there is a need for a """"default""""/global citation key generation behavior which in my opinion should be set in the `citation key patterns`

alt""""skaÌˆrmavbild 2021-02-15 kl  08 32 47"""" src"""" || from my point of view as i proposed in  it needs to the check needs to be  added to the import handler before the key generator is called || > from my point of view as i proposed in 7420 (comment)]( it needs to the check needs to be added to the import handler before the key generator is calledam i reading too much into your comment in that you are aligned with the """"add a checkbox in the import dialog"""" option?in my mind the logic is that a citation key generator object is created based on preferences (`citationkeypatternpreferences`) if the importer wants to override these settings it should create a new instance of this object then it is up to the `citationkeygenerator` to adhere to these preferences admittedly this doesnt work well with `shouldwarnbeforeoverwritecitekey` perhaps i am just overcomplicating things and thinking about this in the wrong way || indeed there is no such thing as missing the mark in our cosy jabref worldthere are two things here that we shouldnt confuse:- use clicks """"generate citation key"""" button controlled by the citation keys > overwrite existing keys preference- automatically generate keys upon import / web search instead of using the one provided by the fetcher (which most of the times is some cryptic key)although from a code point of view they are the same for a user they are quite different and one could easily imagine that a user might want to prevent overwriting manually set keys but still would like to have automatically generated keys upon importi think the best way forward would be to introduce a new preference setting """"generate (new?) key on import""""  that could go in the """"general"""" tab below the other import-related preferences (entry owner + time stamp) or if you feel comfortable enough with the code create a new preference tab """"import"""" where you put all of these 3 preferences options maybe @calixtus has more input about the structure of the preferences || thank you all for the explanations/comments i feel like ive got a better idea about the subject id have to take a closer look at the project again to see whether i feel like id be able to implement the """"create a new import tab in preferences""""-solutioni was wondering though wouldnt the option to decide whether or not to generate a key for a given import in the import dialogue be advantageous as well (on top of the new entry in preferences)? this way a user wouldnt have to change their preferences when importing an entry for which theyd like to go against said preference (as long as im not confusing things again) || i agree that such an option in the import dialog might be handy from time to time however this also makes the import dialog more complicated so im not sure if its a good idea to add it there maybe first try the solution via the preferences and then see if the users would like to have an option during the import as well? || @lucasf-42  it would be really nice if you could go with the simple solution first  that would be a huge benefit already for many users! we can always add an option in the import dialog later || it seems im unable to accomplish even that im afraidive managed to add an """"import settings"""" tab as well as a checkbox for toggling the option (by attempting to copy how other tabs are implemented so nothing to write home about at all)( feature as such seems to be working as well but its messing with something (or more like: breaking something) and i have been unable to understand what exactly it is![image]( exceptions are raised once you have toggled the checkbox in the """"import settings"""" at least once in a session as soon as you delete the last remaining entry within a libraryif the setting has not been changed in a session no matter if the option is enabled or not these exceptions are not raised when deleting the last entry in the libraryhowever the more often you toggle the option the more exceptions are thrownexample after having toggled the setting three times:![image]( want to push the branch in its current (broken) state

kep the number of """"unrelated"""" line changes in diffs low to make it easier to review prs4 of course only a preference but we stick with the standard java code style here to add the brace in the

renamed as well then it contains no items- i think its already possible to have to groups with the same entries: group a is an """"assign entries manually"""" group and group b is a keyword-based group for the field """"groups"""" and value the name of group a the only constraint is currently that group a and group b have to have different names but something as """"group a (dup)"""" as a workaround doesnt seem to bad does this work? is it already sufficient? || > what should happen if the user renames one of the groups? if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no itemsa decent and easy strategy would be to detect this case and leave the old group name as well as the new group name in all entries of the original group then both the new (renamed) group and the old group will contain the same entries and from the point of renaming they start their independent life so to say :)amending the rename code should be easy i can do thata more elaborate solution would be to ask if a user wants to reassign the entries to the new group to the old group(s) or to all of them similar to the question that is asked when changing group hierarchical content but this is more work so the first try would be to leave entries in both old and new group as by default || >  i think its already possible to have to groups with the same entries: group a is an """"assign entries manually"""" group and group b is a keyword-based group for the field """"groups"""" and value the name of group a> the only constraint is currently that group a and group b have to have different names this is exactly what i am trying to avoid! i mean i try to remove this constraint and allow users to create groups with identical names if they wish so> but something as """"group a (dup)"""" as a workaround doesnt seem to bad does this work? is it already sufficient?well for my purposes of using jabref no it is not sufficientthe primary need is to allow identical group names in different parts of the hierarchy without this i just can not use the groups of example i can not migrate automatically my bibliographies from zotero where i do have identical group names in different parts of the tree and migrating our old jabref 3x group assignment is also not possiblethe fact that two groups with the same name always get the same entries is for me an unanticipated feature which can be put to good use once you understand it actually think about groups not as tree leaves but as _sets_ in a mathematical sense a set (group) is defined by its members and the same set can be a member of any other sets (eg branches of a tree)if i need to define a special group of a different kind then ill probably find it too complicated to maintain and will not do it think what happens when i rename your primary group (group a)? all my symlink keyword based groups (group b and friends) will become invalid unless jabref fixes them automatically and how does it know when to fix keyword groups and when not? most often when i change a keyword in an entry this means that it must appear in a different keyword group not that the original keyword group is retargetted to a new keyword || > what should happen if the user renames one of the groups? if the other group is not renamed as well then it contains no itemsalso removing a group should leave entries assigned to the group if other instances of the same group exist i can take care of this as well || im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some cases on the other hand it feels like opening a (small) box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about: renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions (say id-based or full-path-of-group) since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a """"group name > group in tree"""" map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future maintenance im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib file @jabref/developers what do you think? || > im a bit undecided on the one hand i agree that allowing duplicate names would be natural and useful in some casesvery much so!> on the other hand it feels like opening a (small) box of pandora since there are so many things you have to think about: renaming groups deleting moving in the tree manually editing of the groups tree in the bib file it seems to be not that bad actually less dangerous than having full paths in group namesthe mentioned actions seem to make a """"closed complete set of functions"""" (crud?):1 renaming a group is pretty much as it is now extension will be: if another group with the same name exists leave the old group name in all entries and add the new group name if the group was unique: remove old group name from entries add new group name to these entries very natural no information is lost the action is actually reversible! the user can later rename the new group again move it in the tree or """"weed out"""" some entries (without affecting the original group)2 deleting the group is very similar to renaming: if another group with the same name exists no entries need to be changed otherwise group name is removed from all entriesim now experimenting with this functionality in my branch and will add modifications for 1) and 2) to the pr3 moving in the tree: trivial as it is now: just change the position in the list and the indentation number can be done both in gui and by editing/sed-editing the bibtex file4 manually editing of the groups tree: trivial â€“ just delete one row and insert it in another position if yo want it elsewhere this is how i produced the test cases with identical groups before the patch of this pr was implemented tree editing is independent from entry editing unless you want to rename the group manually *and* retain all entries in it5 editing groups in entries: exactly as it is now just add a group name you want and you have added the entry to that named group it will appear in all places of the tree where this group is mentioned the entry editing is independent from the treeno dangers seem to be lurking so far> also it makes it harder to migrate to other solutions (say id-based or full-path-of-group) since the name is no longer unique another point is that we were thinking about adding a nice user interface for the groups and for this a """"group name > group in tree"""" map would be needed in summary allowing duplicate names definitely increases the burden for future maintenancethe most painful migration was from groups 3x to groups 4 where a lot of people (including me :( ) lost their group assignment data well my day was saved by a subversion repo where all my databases reside and a bunch of unix scripts that restored the group assignments others might have been less luckyi see the group assignment by people to be a *very* valuable information â€“ a lot of manual work went into assigning and classifying entries and people rely on them when finding information they need quicklyso an information-preserving migration strategy will be needed anywaya possible migration would be:1 when migrating from the current pr #7558 to a tree where groups in different tree branches are different:    -- if the new format supports  the """"linked"""" groups ie groups that all get the same entries when an entry is added to one of them convert synonymous groups to such entries   -- if the new format does *not* support such functionality just retain groups with identical names and identical sets of entries and warn the user that the behaviour of jabref has changed2 when migrating from the old group format (3x) to the new one as in this pr:    -- if all groups have unique names nothing needs to be changed    -- if some groups in different places of the tree have the same name make only those groups unique by either appending a group parent names (as in treatment (medicine > asthma) and treatment (biocompatibility > surfaces) or by appending just a serial number and warn the user about renaming the user can then adjust group names if they wish but must importantly their precious division of entries into groups is not lost> im tending to keep the error advanced users such as yourself can then still add groups with the same name by editing the groups tree manually in the bib filewell even if i go for this i (and my colleagues) need some reassurance that jabref will keep the present functionality in the future so that our work of adding these groups and assigning entries to them does not go down the drain and keeping such functionality in sight is probably as much work for the jabref team as keeping it with the suggested changes added :)also if i need to use external scripts/editors for managing my bibtex file well its doable but i lose some integration and the nice jabref features like auto-fetch of bibliographies and oa papers would be a pity also it does not seem like a good advertisement for a gui program to say """"well you of course can have this feature but you need to save data open a text editor edit groups by hand (watch out the syntax!) restart/reread the data into jabref""""> @jabref/developers what do you think?keen to hear the

vanish from all old group duplicates this is not what i (and probably most other users) would expect the fix should be easy â€“ if the group(s) with the original name exist somewhere in the tree the old group name should be retained in the entries the entries will thus belong to two groups if one of the duplicates is renamed only of the group name vanishes from the tree it should be removed from the entries as well> ill amend the pr to fix thisthe latest commit fixes this issue now entries are not removed from the remaining synonymous groups if one of them is renamed in that case entries become assigned to both groups the new and the old seems like a very natural behaviour to mehow do you find it? || the more i think about this the more im convinced that it was a bad idea on my side

membershipsif i may chime in:sure if you want to have *unique* keys identifying your internal objects it is a bad idea to rely on external namesthat said i would not say that your idea to use user-provided names as identifiers is so bad it depends on what you want to do if you take users provided group names at their face value as names that users want to use to *identify* their groups then you current implementation logically follows and also a behaviour suggested in pr #7558 logically followsafter a bit of testing and playing around i think i now see the full rationale of placing group names into entries and the emerging behaviour is quite useful â€“ provided that you frankly admit that users *can* create groups with identical names (and gui checks will not stop them ) )note that when we have intermediate groups such as language in computer/language/sql and data/language/sql  or human/language/esperanto the language group if it is a union group and has no entries of its own behaves exactly as it used to behave in the old systemmoreover if you have some entries in the language group it makes perfect sense to make a subgroup language/others where others will contain all """"unassigned"""" languages and move all these entries there then the language union group will continue to display *all* entries as it used before and all other language groups elsewhere in the tree would continue to show the entries in their subgroups a user is free to include groups others into those language groups or not to my taste this is perfectly usable quite transparent and rather

for detailsi think the bibliography tool should allow to do what users want and not to """"disallow"""" something jabref supports a lot of very different bibliography management styles which is its big advantage but the block in the gui that inhibits creation of groups with the same name even in different parts of the hierarchy is a serious usability issue and in this particular respect jabref clearly looses to zotero :( (even thougt the general policy of jabref is so much superior of what other bibliography managers offer!)> im not sure if we really need a warning message the only way to get duplicate names is by manually editing the bib file (or upgrading from an older version) i would say thats pretty rareif a group with the same name in different places of the hierarchy (or even in the same group) is being created it would be nice if the gui would issue a warning here not a blocking error the warning would explain that the group with the same name already exists (and mention its places in the hierarchy) but let the user do what he/she wants explicit and complete information wold remove most of confusion imho the gui could even suggest a unique group name based on its current place in the group hierarchy || > the only way to get duplicate names is by manually editing the bib file (or upgrading from an older version) i would say thats pretty rarein my case it is not rare but *ubiquitous* and judging from other responses in #1495 and other related posts many users miss the group hierarchy with arbitrary group names i tried to use a workaround in #1495 like """"diabetes > treatment"""" and with the current implementation it is very very inconvenient || so lets sum up the current situation:1 the current group implementation has useful features (nicely summarised in #629: independence of bibtex entries possibility to manually edit bibtex file for grouping among the others)2 users want flexible hierarchy and want to be able to create groups with whatever names they want without a tool standing in their waya possible (easy?) way to reconcile these two requirements could be:- jabref supports (as it already does now!) groups with *identical* names anywhere in the hierarchy no changes is needed here just the promise that the future versions of jabref will not """"disallow"""" such use of jabref :)- the gui allows creating such groups if the user wants to (so that we do not have to save the database close jaberef edit the file by hand restart jabref every time i want the group that has a name already in the hierarchy) for this and the following functionality a change would be needed in jabref but the change will be small and localised (affecting presumably only the group creation dialogue)- the gui *warns* the user that the group already exists elsewhere in the hierarchy and that of created this group will contain *the* *same* entries as all other groups with the same name (i estimate that  "";1;0;merge  into

assessments of the younger more commonly affected adolescent population despite limited prospective data for adolescents the incidence of operative fixation of adolescent diaphyseal clavicle fractures has increasedpurpose: to detail the demographic features and descriptive epidemiology of a large pooled cohort of adolescent patients with diaphyseal clavicle fractures presenting to pediatric tertiary care centers in the united states through an observational prospective multicenter cohort study (function after adolescent clavicle trauma and surgery [facts])study design: cross-sectional study level of evidence 4methods: patients aged 10 to 18 years who were treated for a diaphyseal clavicle fracture between august 2013 and february 2016 at 1 of 8 geographically diverse high-volume tertiary care pediatric centers were screened treatment was rendered by any of the pediatric orthopaedic providers at each of the 8 institutions which totaled more than 50 different providers age sex race ethnicity fracture laterality hand dominance mechanism of injury injury activity athletic participation fracture characteristics and treatment decisions were prospectively recorded in those who were eligible and consented to enrollresults: a total of 545 patients were included in the cohort the mean age of the study population was 141 Â± 21 years and 79\% were male fractures occurred on the nondominant side (56\%) more frequently than the dominant side (44\%) sport was the predominant activity during which the injury occurred (66\%) followed by horseplay (12\%) and biking (6\%) the primary mechanism of injury was a direct blow/hit to the shoulder (60\%) overall 54\% were completely displaced fractures defined as fractures with no anatomic cortical contact between fragments mean shortening within the completely displaced group was 219 mm when measuring the distance between fragment ends (end to end) and 124 mm when measuring the distance between the fragment end to the corresponding cortical defect (cortex to corresponding cortex) on the other fragment (ie true shortening) comminution was present in 18\% of all fractures while 83\% of all clavicle fractures were treated nonoperatively 32\% of completely displaced fractures underwent open reduction and internal fixationconclusion: adolescent clavicle fractures occurred more commonly in male patients during sports secondary to a direct blow to the shoulder and on the nondominant side slightly more than half of these fractures were completely displaced and approximately one-fifth were comminuted within this large cohort approximately one-third of patients with completely displaced fractures underwent surgery allowing for future prospective comparative analyses of radiographic clinical and functional

and if not is it possible for me to change the generated files? || i came across this issue and its inded a problem of the generated unmarshaller i am not an expert in xml and those schema stuff but from my opinion it should be necessary to adjust the xsd schema to add some kind of content attribute for the url attribute to represent the text without a style```<urls>				<related-urls>					<url>						<style face""""normal"""" font""""default"""" size""""100%"""">&ltgo to							isi&gt://wos:000377368200039</style>					</url>				</related-urls>				<pdf-urls>					<url>/users/xxxx/_jabreftep/menezes2018 - map2check using llvm and kleepdf</url>				</pdf-urls>			</urls>```the xsd file is here: || i am currently working on this issue but i get a little lost  now could you give me some hints or start points on that issue @siedlerchr?

its very fast for same selection size(10) with only 10 entries the reason its a concern is because currently the gen process can be interrupted without warning so unless its remains very quick and completes before a user can take action it potentially can be interrupted with no notification nor indication where it left offwould it be better to block until complete? i dont know typical working numbers but 100000 entries seems like it would be a rarity so maybe my understanding of the issues at hand are a bit skewed but maybe there is a better solution that addresses the potential for interruptioni would like to add someone probably wouldnt be requesting task progress-monitoring for something with a very quick resolutioni would be interested to hear what someone else thought || hi`the reason its a concern is because currently the gen process can be interrupted without warning`why would that be a problem? if the user wants to interrupt why not interrupt? the question is if there is a need to revert all the entries that were assigned a new key to the old key in case of an interruption || @btut i dont disagree i think the process should be stopped if the user intends to stop it but _**only**_ if they intend to stop it its been awhile since ive checked the issue out but what im remembering was starting the process and continuing to work (which i think was just clicking on entries to examine) this would stop the gen process and without notification if more clarification would be helpful let me know and i can revisit to refresh my memoryimo:reverting sounds like an undo-state save i have no experience implementing but it seems like it should be doable there could be performance issues i didnt dig too deeply but noticed the time it takes for a set of only 10 to complete (quick) was much longer for that same 10 (slow) if they were included in the gen process for a very large set || `but only if they intend to stop it`so you suggest something like a confirmation dialogue on cancel?`this would stop the gen process and without notification`i see id have to check that the thing is i dont have a library large enough to test this there is no way im fast enough to hit that cancel button before the operation is done do you know of any huge bib files available for download to test this out? otherwise i may just generate one with random strings`reverting sounds like an undo-state save`exactly but i dont have any experience there either do you think this is necessary? is it a valid usecase to interrupt the key-generation and expect it to revert to the previous state?`a set of only 10 to complete (quick) was much longer for that same 10 (slow) if they were included in the gen process for a very large set`i guess the non-linearity comes from jabref making sure the keys are unique || i think at very least a dialog asking if they want to stop the process i dont know all conditions that could interrupt and it may make more sense to just block with a dialog? again as you found out its pretty quick if you arent doing very many but then the question became if its so quick the blocking dialog will not be seen why bother having it display the progress  there are some script files you can use to build a lib with look in the _scripts/_ directory there are also some already made i havent looked at them but they are buried in test/resources/testbib/i think the undo would have been requested if users wanted to take advantage of something like that to me the undoing sounds like issue creep and should be its own separate issue  || > a set of only 10 to complete (quick) was much longer for that same 10 (slow) if they were included in the gen process for a very large set>> i guess the non-linearity comes from jabref making sure the keys are uniqueyup the implementation slows down significantly based on the number of entries in the library and the amount of duplicates of the particular key is this a problem that needs fixing?  || `yup the implementation slows down significantly based on the number of entries in the library and the amount of duplicates of the particular key is this a problem that needs fixing?`i did not yet experience any performance issues since i never worked with huge libraries will try out in the next daysdidnt yet check the implementation of the key-generator either but this sounds like the generator checks against all generated keys on each entry so maybe something like a key -> occurencecount hashmap would be more efficient || @btut it checks all keys on each entry and each collision i think `occurencecount` isnt used anymore and the method can be made slightly quicker (and more readable) by using `databasegetentrybykey` instead you can use a hash set instead of `databasegetentrybykey` but i think youd get a slight performance decrease because we dont expect many citation key collisionsadditionally it seems that we are assuming that any entry can be changed at any time during the key generation which is why it is iterating through all bibentries creating a high-performing alternative while avoiding concurrency issues is probably not worth your time [even if we are not doing xp]( || `additionally it seems that we are assuming that any entry can be changed at any time during the key generation which is why it is iterating through all bibentries creating a high-performing alternative while avoiding concurrency issues is probably not worth your time even if we are not doing xp`ah yes that makes lots of sense! lets leave it as-is then ||;1;0;merge branch main into fix/keygenerationbackgroundtask;"
